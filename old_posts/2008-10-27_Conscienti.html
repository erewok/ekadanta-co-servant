PBS aired a documentary this evening that was loosely about contemporary conscientious objectors and the moral considerations of war.

The most interesting part was the phrasing used by those building arguments, both for against, which relied on abstract, universal terms to state a position. In fact, even the military requires that those filing for CO status posit their absolute rejection of all wars.

By contrast, it could be that the tendency to draw abstract universals out of practical reality is greatly involved in war (which has very little to do with immediate conflict). In fact, it seems that sustained conflict is really only viable from a theoretical position, a place of comfort that derives legitimacy from its philosophical underpinnings.   

Of course we derive common morality from abstract universals, or at least we think we do, so antagonizng these universals appears to threaten the morality we were using to achieve critical distance. In other words, blaming the tendency to construct universal moral claims seems to prevent us from having any morals whatsoever.

This is a discussion that Nietzsche was interested in, and while his questions are good, we are left with little practical direction to go in. We can study the phenomenon of moralizing perhaps, to see where we feel and to get a better sense of our goals and the political realities (self-interests) of war.
