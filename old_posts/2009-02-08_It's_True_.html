This weekend I was regaled with stories of how terrible the publishing industry is by the smart young people who are mysteriously running the publishing industry.

This was the 25th annual SDSU Writer's Conference where folks flew in from all over to pitch their self-help, mystery, literary, memoir, children's books to the editors and agents who flew inÂ  mostly from the coasts.

On the first day, the genrefication of things was the first and most obvious lesson for participants, who met and greeted each other in the ballroom at the Doubletree Hotel and who were invited to sit at tables with centerpiece signs displaying each table's genre. I chose a table labeled "Suspense/Thriller" because it had already been colonized by a group of friendly retirees and since I'd never write a true suspense novel, I knew there would be no competition between us. In addition, I thought it most likely the place to see some weird stuff, but I was quickly informed that the "Other" table was the best place for that.
