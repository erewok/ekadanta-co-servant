At the Monterrey Bay Aquarium, they have a corner bubble where seawater shoots over the top and you can see through the glass how the fish that live in the intertidal zone respond. Little kids hang out in there and they jump up and scream whenever the water shoots down, like it's the greatest trick.

But actually, it is a great trick. There's something joyful about the water sheeting down, maybe like the way those automatic carwashes used to be so great as a kid, the giant rollers, the foam splatters, the high-pressure hoses, all while a mover calmly conveys the car from one edge of the washing house to the next.
