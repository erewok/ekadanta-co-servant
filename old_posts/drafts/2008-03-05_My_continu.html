Today David wrote to me to interpret yesterday's events in Ohio and Texas and (I think) to ask for money again (there's a kind of predictable streak to his emails in that way, but he's always been like that since he first started emailing me). Anyway, here are some of the highlights from his email (and I don't think he meant this to me in confidence, so I can fairly publish it here):

<blockquote>Erik --

Our projections show the most likely outcome of yesterday's elections will be that Hillary Clinton gained 187 delegates, and we gained 183. That's a net gain of 4 delegates out of more than 370 delegates available from all the states that voted.

The task for the Clinton campaign yesterday was clear. In order to have a plausible path to the nomination, they needed to score huge delegate victories and cut into our lead.

They failed.

It's clear, though, that Senator Clinton wants to continue an increasingly desperate, increasingly negative -- and increasingly expensive -- campaign to tear us down.

That's her decision. But it's not stopping John McCain, who clinched the Republican nomination last night, from going on the offensive. He's already made news attacking Barack, and that will only become more frequent in the coming days.</blockquote>
I have printed my response in full below:
<blockquote> David,

While I agree with your emphasis on the delegate count after yesterday's events, I actually prefer a summary of the action that I heard this morning on the radio. It ran something like this, "We started out down by 20 points in Texas and Ohio." (I'm sure you'll probably recognize the author of the quote.)

In these words, I realized that somewhere along the line everyone (by which I mean the press and the people who care what they have to say (and I include myself in this number)) had taken it for granted that Obama was going to win Ohio and Texas when in fact the situation there was far more muddy.

Beyond that, the exit polling in yesterday's contests suggests that last minute voters voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton and I believe this was due in part to a strategic error on Obama's part: talking about NAFTA. Of course, it's not as if he shouldn't discuss NAFTA, but it was always going to be a mistake to cultivate such a strident opinion on something in a way that appeared disingenuous to everyone outside the Ohio race especially when his stridency could be demonstrated to be mere political posturing (which it was).

Now, this is a serious error for Obama as any that cuts to the heart of his candor would be. You have pointed out fairly that Clinton's camp went negative on Obama in drawing this out and I think this is an accurate assessment. However, negativity in this case had an identifiable and damage-causing target, and this must not happen again or the whole character of Obama will be irreparably tarnished (if it's not already).

Outside of this discussion, an oft-repeated refrain has it that McCain can now focus on the general election to the detriment of any democrat's chances of winning in November, and I think there are flaws in this thinking. Consider, for instance, that for every news story featuring John McCain there are four to six describing Clinton and Obama, a fact demonstrated by even conservative papers like the New York Post, for example, which yesterday ran a cover story on Obama and Clinton in Texas. McCain then must shout a whole lot louder to be heard as a general election candidate when such an exciting primary continues to grip the entire nation.

Another way of looking at this is through the eyes of the mythical "independent" voter, whose attention is entirely engaged right now by what's happening on the left. Do we really want to let McCain have the stage and to get the eyes of these "independents" back on him?

In addition, McCain, without any clear opponent for a general election (and please don't think here that I don't agree with your overall mathematical assessment), has no one to attack. He's tried to attack Obama but that really hasn't gotten much press out here in Southern California, and beyond that I'm not sure anyone was listening (again, this is an exciting primary).

Thus, from where I'm sitting out here in the audience, it appears that a prolonged primary season could be beneficial overall (but I could just be saying this because I hate general elections) to a democrat's chances in November.

Finally, the real way for Obama to win is not to say the same things that Clinton is saying only louder (and here again I'm thinking of the NAFTA mistake), but to distinguish himself from Clinton by virtue of policy positions and speeches during her tenure in the senate. Pointing out her voting on the Iraq war is a good start, but there are other inconsistencies in her record that made national voters wary of her from the start of her campaign. It seems obvious that increasing this wariness is the key to a resounding Obama victory.

As always, I await your thoughts.

Best,

Erik

ps. I don't have any money for you this month because I'm unemployed and I had to spend my last $40 on a tune-up for my car.</blockquote>
