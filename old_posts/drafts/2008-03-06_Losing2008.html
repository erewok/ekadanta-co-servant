I'm really terrible at chess, but I like to play (and lose). Or I guess that "liking" isn't really any kind of verb I can use for my playing of chess because when I play my blood pressure starts on the increase and sweat materializes in my armpits and I can hear the blood pounding in my throat. Continuing to think about the verbs, it's not that I "want" to win, but that some mysterious fight or flight mechanisms have been triggered in relation to the abstraction of "winning" and "losing".

As you can see, I really shouldn't be playing chess with any humans. But this presents a problem because the flattened cartoons on the screen in computer versions of the game don't correlate well in my mind with actual pieces moving around a playing space. For this reason, computer chess simulators regularly decimate me before I even know what's happening.

However, I discovered last week that if I take the time to set up a real chess board and if for every move I enter into the computer and the computer responds to, I then set the corresponding moves down on this actual board, then my performance improves dramatically. I'm not winning, but I can see what's happening much differently than when I play the cartoon squares. At the very least, I can lose elegantly this way.
