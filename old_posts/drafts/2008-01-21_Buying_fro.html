At left is an image of unroasted coffee from the farmer's market in our neighborhood. The guy who sells this stuff is named Raul, and he and his wife import their coffee from Guatemala. In addition, Raul will be teaching a class at Grossmont College this semester on the production and process of making coffee, so I had the opportunity to ask him some questions about coffee-keeping, preparation, and brewing.

Firstly, on the question of whether or not coffee should be frozen, he said it can be "freezer-burned," but that "you want to keep it in a cool, dry place so the refrigerator should be fine."

Raul actually sells the unroasted coffee pictured at left for a few dollars less than the roasted coffee, and in this way his customers have the most control over the kind of roast they get. It's not hard to roast it, apparently, "you just put some beans in a pan for about five minutes until they pop, like popcorn." The darker the roast, the more caffeine has been leached out of the beans.

Finally, all the coffee Raul sells is Fair-Trade certified, a process by which a particular organization ensures that farmers are paid fair-wages for their coffee. In the past, he explained, farmers who worked for huge corporations like Folger's were a few steps above indentured-servitude as they were invited to come pick for the coffee harvest, and then immediately told to leave after the harvest was over. Other coffee farmers had no idea what their coffee was worth on the world market and so large distributors could take advantage of them. Thus, fair-Trade certification merely means that farmers aren't getting screwed on the world market.

The coffee tastes pretty good, and Raul sells it at the same rate that we buy coffee beans from the supermarket for. In addition, he freely shares his expertise, which is one thing a question-obsessed consumer like myself finds most agreeable about the farmer's market.
