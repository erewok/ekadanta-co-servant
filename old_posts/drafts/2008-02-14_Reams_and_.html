In the past month I've started receiving junk mail in the mailbox at my house. This might be mundane to most but to me it's interesting because I worked hard for about a month to eliminate all junk mail, a process that involved calling every junk mail sender and requesting being removed from their lists. The junk mail I receive now, however, is much different than the litter I got before, and that's because it mostly comes from a terrible online firm called Carol Wright Gifts.

What happened was I needed a typewriter to type up IRS Form 1023 for a small nonprofit that I started. I looked around online (inexpensive manual typewriters are hard to find, actually) and finally found a Royal typewriter at Carol Wright Gifts, so I ordered it.

This was all well and good. The typewriter arrived, everything was fine. Except for one thing: after I unpacked the typewriter I discovered that it was really a poor quality product, likely a knock-off. In fact, the machine came in box that loudly declared "Made in China," and it had a small sheet of instructions on it with a variety of misspelled words. To my eyes, this screams "knock-off."

In addition (and this may sound ridiculous, but it's true), the typewriter smelled. Actually, it reeked. I couldn't unpack the thing without all of the windows open because the typewriter actually reeked of formaldehyde (a chemical forever burned into my mind after one year of cat dissection in a physiology class).  Formaldehyde is a commonly used manufacturing chemical that is <a href="http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/formaldehyde/">"<span class="blueTen">reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen,"</span></a><span class="blueTen"> according to OSHA. Remember all of that news about the FEMA trailers? Yeah, that was formaldehyde. </span>

At any rate, the typewriter I ordered is a little piece of toxic waste that I can't really use, but that's not actually the worst part. The worst part, in my mind, is that Carol Wright Gifts sold my address to other firms and now I receive a daily deluge of junk mail from Carol Wright Gifts, from Publisher's Clearinghouse, from life insurance providers, etc. The common theme in all this junk mail? Whoever sending it to me seems convinced that I'm either incontinent, because I need plastic sheets or plastic underwear, or that I'm in need of denture-cleaning and pill-organizing products. In other words, that I'm <em>very old</em>.

Are the old the only people who'd need or want manual typewriters these days? Are there other "companies" that prey upon the elderly?
