The waves come in on the westerly south-westerly swells and glance just under the forward crane at the front end of this grounded ship. These waves are predictable and easy to ride and a number of Southern California transplants live in little bungalows on the beach here, just to the left of where the photograph has been taken. We were told a plot of land could be leased for $4,000 a year, and that a bungalow could be constructed for under $10k.

One day we were there and a group of kids came in from town to fire rocks at the ship with their slingshots.

In recent months crime has reportedly increased in the form of carjackings and robberies, so we'll likely not be making the four-hour drive anytime soon into Mexico.
