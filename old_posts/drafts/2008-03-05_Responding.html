David Plouffe keeps emailing me personally to talk interpret Barack Obama's election "victories" and "losses" and in his emails he perpetually makes a plea for money, which I firmly rebuff because I'm looking for work right now and I can't afford it.  Since David always neglects to respond to the issues I raise in my emails, I realized that I should maybe start posting them here on the internet.

Here's an abridged version of the first one I got from David:
<blockquote><strong>Subject: RE: Will you make a call for me?</strong>‏
From: 	David Plouffe, BarackObama.com</blockquote>
<blockquote>Erik --

Make calls nowI need you to make your voice heard today -- literally.

Over the past week, supporters have made more than 700,000 phone calls right from their own homes. They are reaching out to voters in Ohio, Texas, Rhode Island, and Vermont before the March 4th primaries.

We've set a goal of 1 million calls to help Get Out The Vote for these critical contests -- will you help?

All you need is a few minutes, a phone line, and a passion for change. Start making calls right now:

Personal contact is the best way to grow this movement, and now you can make these connections right from your own home.</blockquote>
Here is my first response:
<blockquote><strong>Subject: Here's what I don't get</strong>‏
From: 	Erik Aker

Why does David Plouffe get to "Reply All" and I don't?

Sincerely,

Erik Aker</blockquote>
