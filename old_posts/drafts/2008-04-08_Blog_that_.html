So it turns out (in a very loose causal connection) that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/technology/06sweat.html?_r=1&amp;scp=8&amp;sq=blogger&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin">blogging might kill you</a> if you get stressed enough about it. The death factor comes, apparently, from the incessantly instantaneous demands of the internet information cycle.

Now,  I certainly know what this article is talking about it because I, for one, stay up thinking about what I'm going to post each month on this site. But the article does draw out an interesting element that few mention: there is an extreme demand for news that is cultivated by the content pushed out daily on the internet. Actually, I think it's an artificial demand and evidence for this shows up in the fact that it is tech-news that is most widely consumed.

In fact, the only thing that makes tech-blogs special is the fact that they were really the first instant-news blogs to populate the landscape. Thus, there are a lot of people out there sucking up feeds that they probably wouldn't miss, and they're doing this probably just to have something to read when they could be otherwise working.

Moreover, the volume of content from the producer's side is actually unsustainable.  Forgetting writer death for a moment, it's simply not wise to produce this much stuff for so little profit, but it will probably be a little while before the market catches up with this fact.

At that time, expect to see a lot of recycled content, like re-runs, and a lot of cut corners. Until then, how many more bloggers will have to die before the insanity stops?
