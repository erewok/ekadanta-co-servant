We were recently given a first-generation xbox and since I'm indifferent and naive when it comes to videogaming, it seemed like a dull and melodramatically heavy piece of hardware to offer space in our apartment to. Because of this, the thing sat in place with its Darth Vader exterior for a couple of months while an idea began to form in my mind.

Actually, what happened was another idea running cross-currently apparently wasn't following its track-signals and so  ran an intersection, jumped the junction, and plowed right into the monolithic black box. The negligent idea was this: computer media center.

The xbox, in fact, is really a quite capable computer, designed and built to do a few dull and repetitive tasks: 1) respond to button-mashing, 2) display eye-catching (often busty) graphics. As an aside, it turns out to be quite easy to "softmod" (software modify) the xbox which opens up its capabilities so it can perform more like a traditional pc. To softmod the thing, all you need to do is take it to a place called <a href="http://sdmods.com">sdmods.com</a> along with forty dollars in cash and hang out for an hour with the streams of nerds coming in with a game console in one hand and forty dollars in the other. It's gray-area stuff, but blandly so, something Raymond Chandler might have included in a story.

Anyway, once it's been modded, you now have in your hands a "media center" with which you can tap into the vast fleets of absurd information available on the internet using only 1) the freed xbox, 2) the internet, and 3) your television.

Our xbox, for instance, now runs an operating system called XBMC, with which it can view YouTube content, play media saved on other computers in our house, and run scripts to find and view whatever else is out there.

In our house, an early favorite plucked from that fog of "whatever else" is the Monterrey Bay Aquarium's live otter webcam. Blurry, cramped, soggy, the image of their display-home briefly reveals them screwing by on our television at random intervals. But their toys look fun!

Last night we also watched (who am i kidding: we <em>lived through</em> is apter) the original pilot for <em>Miami Vice</em>, and we ironically viewed an episode of the <em>Adventures of Fat Albert</em>. <em>Miami Vice</em> was flat-out awesome, while <em>Fat Albert</em> was surprisingly more pedantic than I remember. These two shows were posted legally and for free on a trendy new site called <a href="http://hulu.com">hulu.com</a> where television shows past and present can be viewed, and for which some kind soul recently made a script to run on XBMC. This allowed us, in addition to the above, to tour some <em>New Yorker</em> cartoons, an episode of <em>Air Wolf</em>, the most recent episode of <em>The Office</em> and <em>Eddie Murphy Raw</em>.

In other words, there's a ton of information we can now get onto our TV. It's a weird and dizzying feeling to be suddenly on the edge of this thing, this gulf of content. I think I'll take the opportunity to quote my favorite passage from <em>Moby Dick</em>:
<blockquote>Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harborless immensities.</blockquote>
Everything in this sentence is perfect, so I take no pleasure in noting how perfectly it applies to the yawn of <em>Miami Vice</em> episodes that has just opened up before me.
