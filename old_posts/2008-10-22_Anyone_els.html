Because that's about how I feel whenever the song comes on, in part as a surprised reaction to an image of myself in a truck in the heartland as I'm driving my corn crop to the elevator that swells up in my patriotic soul. What I really want is to mellow on this feeling for awhile, stew in it, figure out where it comes from and, really, figure out who it endorses for president.

At the moment we are knee-deep in war metaphors to describe the presidential election contest, but one thing I've noticed this year is that the heartland is somewhat conspicuously absent from newspaper reports. Instead, we're hearing about "battleground states" like Kentucky where <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/la-na-senate22-2008oct22,0,7247857.story?track=rss">Democrats are hoping to "exact revenge"</a>, not to mention latte-filled places like Pennsylvania and even Florida.

Perhaps now that only 1-2% of the nation's population are farmers or that California is one of the largest agriculture-producing states or perhaps now that all of those hippy farmers are going organic it's time to retire the heartland as a political metaphor for the rest of us?

I, for one, will be sad to see it go. How else will I describe the feeling I get when "Take It to the Limit" doesn't last long enough and has to be spun another time around?
