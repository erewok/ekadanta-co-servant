It was 90 degrees in San Diego today. At a little league game, all the parents were complaining about the stiff heat, and I had two conversations about how there's "no normal weather" anymore, a thought I figured I'd research a little.

According to the National Weather Service, temperatures in San Diego in November "seldom rise above 80," and there are a few days on record at or above 90 degrees. Today's high heat, however, was another day like the majority in our month: when I looked at the weather report last Thursday I was told that the rest of the week was supposed to be like this, not to mention the two hot, dry weeks that began our month. Accompany their weather,  yesterday and the three days before are all marked by similar conversations.

In other words, it's hot, it's weird, and people are talking about it, which brings me to this other thing that people are talking about: gas prices and the decline of the American auto industry. In fact, on the radio just now was a piece on how little support there is for an auto industry bailout.

This seemed obvious. Whether or not they've got the story right, a suprising unanimity of people I've spoken with lately have hinted uneasily about this odd weather as only explainable by global warming, and in Southern California the most obvious symbol of this impending catastrophe is the car, for some years fetishized and beloved.

For evidence of increasing ambivalence about the car and the belief that cars are connected to our miserable weather, we might be able to trace social sentiment about cars. But this is a tricky thing to do. 

For one example, gas prices have continued to fall as a result of demand, and now they're lower then they've been for a long time. Further, scooters are still selling well in traditionally slower months like October and November (and in a poor economy). 

If gas prices remain depressed, people might start taking to their cars again with their previous free abandon. But if the weather stays as it is, there is a constant reminder of the broader cost of driving, which is still something that our built environment prevents us from giving up, no matter how awkward and guilty we feel.
