Let me tell you about this dream I had. I was in vons, shopping for sundries, when I realized I didn't have enough money to pay for the goods. Then, when I was in line I decided I would flirt with the woman cashier to see if she would give me things for free. It was working really well: she started throwing things in for free and my bill went from $98 to $41. But then I began to worry she was really interested in me and that she'd like to see me outside of Vons. I paid my $41 and left. In the dream, she was a very obese person.
