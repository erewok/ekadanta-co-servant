Shan got the Saturn on her 18th birthday. This was 1996, the heyday of a car branded with the kind of folksy feel nowadays reserved for farmer's markets. At the time, GM was running commercials on TV describing how they had invited Saturn owners to a cookout at the Saturn plant and, the commercial boasted, a whole lot of people came out "to spend their vacations with us."

At the time, a good friend of mine had parents who owned a Saturn, and I think the car appealed to a generation of people frustrated with the usual alienating process of purchasing a car where one drives to a car lot, one haggles tirelessly, one is sent to the backroom where a manager attempts to sell lots of useless things to the buyer. The whole process is cloaked in an aura of scheming and manipulation and dirty sales tricks. Saturn dealerships likely participated in this car-selling exploitation, but the Saturn brand worked hard to be associated with a more authentic, down-home idea of the car, and they even promised a no-haggling, fixed-price concept for Saturn dealerships.

I first became acquainted with Shan's Saturn when she was driving us to a movie. When I sat down in the car and she fired it up, I noticed with some alarm that the oil light remained lit. 

I said, "Your oil light is on."

She said, "I know. I'll change it soon."

"It's not supposed to be a suggestion to change it," I said. "It means the car needs oil or the motor will blow up. You should pull over so we can buy some oil."

She was surprised to discover this is what the oil light meant. Why would the light come on when it was already too late, in a way?

As I was draining oil into the car, I looked at the underside of the cap, which was blackened and stained.

"Have you ever changed the oil on this car?" I asked.

"A few years ago," she said. The odometer showed around 70,000 miles and by my calculation, she had managed to drive maybe 30,000 miles without changing the oil.

About a year after she first bought the Saturn, someone hit the driver's side door, making it impossible to roll down the window, so eventually I got her a new car door as a birthday gift. It wasn't a surprise, however. She was involved in the purchasing process, demanding a door that matched the color of the car. I thought it was pointless calling junkyards and asking them if they had a <i>silver</i> driver's side door for a Saturn, and ultimately, I prevailed on her to accept a bright blue door instead. She would only acquiesce when I promised she wouldn't have to drive the car, and that I'd be happy to drive a silver car with a blue door.

This was a success for Shan and for me, a result of the mostly plastic construction of the car which was touted as a lightweight, dent-resistant, rust-resistant, and money-saving alternative to the traditional steel contraptions that have pervaded the history of the car.

More recently, after Shan's Saturn lay unused in our driveway for a few months, we decided to let her brother-in-law drive it for awhile, but he had no attachment to the vehicle, so when the water pump stopped working, instead of replacing it, he merely filled up the coolant reservoir with water whenever the car's temperature gauge threatened red. This later made the water pump incredibly difficult to remove because those gallons and gallons of tap water had rusted all the hardware that mounted the water pump to the underside of the motor.

Once we surmounted the stubborn water pump, the car mysteriously continued to overheat, but that was due to a now defunct radiator, so with the help of a friend we replaced that as well. Over the course of its lifetime, then, this car managed to incur for us a great deal of stress and frustration, but in a way, this is the role of the car: it's an expensive tool that we are married to. This relationship is duplicated around the country by millions of people, who are forced to dump money into an object that will at some mysterious future point become totally unreliable.

The last great trip the Saturn took was to a wedding near Rosarito and on the return trip, the car threatened to overheat for the entire 2-hour process of waiting at the San Ysidro border crossing. We ran the heater. We turned the car off. We looked at the sparkly Last Supper bas reliefs and the grilled sweet corn on sale on either side of the border line-up. We really really hoped the car wouldn't explode in Mexico. And it didn't. So we were lucky again.

Although the car sailed through its smog check, normally a golden ticket for an older vehicle in California, it continued to threaten a decline. The tires were going bald, so we didn't drive it on the freeway, and one day it wouldn't shift out of reverse. This was because the linkage at the base of the stickshift, connected to the end of the cables from the transmission, was broken. Apparently these break all the time because they're made of plastic and subject to forces that stress them over the lifetime of the car. They brake so often, in fact, that Napa Auto Parts makes a Saturn-specific, $4 replacement part that looks like a tiny crown for a chipmunk-sized king. GM refused to make such a part, instead offering only a new cable bundle, which involves a major transmission service that would cost about $400 or more. Undoubtedly the problem had come to their attention, and may have even come to their attention before they stopped producing the Saturns that had this problem.

The history of this car, in short, is one of its various problems and the remedies we had for them. A car is a constant drain on resources, but unfortunately a necessary one. As we become wedded to these vehicles, we imbue them with personalities and associations because we'd like to imagine (or we've been trained to imagine) that we are traveling in a particular style that is an ostensible representation of our own inner sensibility. In this regard, no one would probably like to imagine that their own inner style is a decrepit and waning machine.

Ultimately, Shan's Saturn gave out last week while climbing a hill. This was long-in-coming and so somewhat expected. It just stopped going and then stalled. When it started again, it sounded sickly, like it had a rumbling in the lungs. It refused to move at all, like an overused horse. I realized that it was time to retire the vehicle.

Similarly, GM stated recently that it was time to retire the once powerful brand. At one time, Saturn was one of the best-selling car brands in the country, but now it is just another dismantled idea. 

For millions of people in financially precarious positions, cars are the best daily lesson on the intelligent investment of scant resources. We are constantly trying to measure the worth of the vehicle against its costs. As such, we are constantly plagued with difficult decisions. Should I fix its current difficulty or save my money? Should I sell the vehicle or keep driving it? Is it worth keeping? If I sell it, will I simply be dumping my future problems onto an unsuspecting buyer? Can I prepare someone for the shroud of expectation that attends on this machine? 

Should I buy another one?
