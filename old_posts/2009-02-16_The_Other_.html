Last week while everyone was <a title="peanut_piece" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/02/08/business/peanut.1-424970.php">freaking out about peanuts</a> causing Salmonella, there was another quiet little arrival of something even worse: Listeria.

Of course, no one got sick from eating the <a href="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7013933549">infected mushrooms</a>, but Listeria is known to be deadlier than Salmonella, especially to the young and old, and anyone with a compromised immune system. Reading about the Listeria mushrooms, I couldn't help recalling an article I put together a couple years ago, where <a href="http://www.vcreporter.com/cms/story/detail/?id=4008&amp;IssueNum=99">I talked to some cool people</a> on the subject of foodborne pathogens and the changing ways in which Americans purchase food.

Probably the interview that will haunt me forever was a discussion I had with<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Nicols%20Fox"> Nichols Fox</a> about her research into foodborne pathogens. In short, her argument was that the modern system of agricultural production is to be blamed for current (and future) mass outbreaks of diseases linked to food. The scariest thing about it were all of the examples she had to make her point.

In one example she told me about how a dairy company was linked to Salmonella. Apparently, their dairy trucks were first delivering egg whites and, instead of cleaning their trucks out, they were immediately driving over and filling up with milk. This milk-and-egg-white mixture ended up in cartons of milk and ultimately ended up being an efficient way of spreading Salmonella all over the midwest.

In another example she told me about how hamburger meat is now ground up from hundreds of different cattle from a variety of countries. "And don't get me started on salad bars," she said, which I didn't. She then went on to describe how "washed" salad in prepackaged bags is really unwashed salad with inert gasses sprayed into the bags to keep the surface symptoms of decay from showing up on the salad.

The best example she gave me, and one I like to scare my friends with, was when she described an outbreak of Listeria on the eastern seaboard. Initially, investigators thought the Listeria was coming from strawberries, but then they discovered rasberries were to blame. These raspberries were coming from Guatemalen farms where field hands were given nowhere to go to the bathroom. This forced them to urinate and defecate in the irrigation ditches, which supplied water that was mixed with pesticide, which was then sprayed onto the raspberries.

In other words, it's important to know where your food comes from. With examples like these it becomes clear that mass-produced food is often counterintuitive to what people actually want to eat. Of course, buying locally won't totally eradicate the problem, but it will prevent millions of people from getting sick the next time there's an outbreak of a foodborne pathogen because it will limit the spread of disease to small, local communities.

I guess I'm just surprised we still haven't learned these lessons.

One more thing, there's a pretty cool <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gQYuCheM8PNFc_4o2Opa_qnDdoMgD967VB080">timeline the AP put together</a> on the Salmonella outbreak. It reveals the gaps in the system of analysis and prevention.
