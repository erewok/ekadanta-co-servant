On day three at the writing conference, I spent more time with the hard realists because three writing conference days are the equivalent of a stretch of cynical, world-wearying years out in reality. With one exception which I'll get to in a moment, the bleak, young industrialists I met on Sunday were all crabby and ready to leave San Diego for their own overstuffed offices.

More than one person said "It's one of the worst times in the industry," at the panels, and floating over these discussions lay an ominous haze drawn by the cloak of "new media."

On Sunday, however, I also learned the word "platform." As taught to me by the chipper youth (the previously mentioned exception) who edits for one of the mid-market publishing houses in New York, "platform" is "anything you can do to reach an audience so it's easier for us to sell your book."

Why does an author need platform? The publishing houses can actually count on their hands the customers they care about, and according to that editor "Selling books to Barnes and Noble means selling you as a person." In other words, platform is necessary for the tables and signs large bookstores will use to create the person (you) that they will use to move the product (your book, in dull, stuff-speak).

Right. Are you ready to get some platform? Here's a short list of what you'll need to do:
<ul>
	<li>Networking (find and know everybody)!</li>
	<li>Publish things!</li>
	<li>Start a blog!</li>
	<li> Collect the email addresses of "fans" on your blog!</li>
	<li>Start a blog for your main character!</li>
	<li>Get some tape!</li>
	<li>Start a facebook page!</li>
	<li>Add everyone to your facebook page!</li>
</ul>
As she noted the last one, she went on to say, "You guys all need to go home right now and start your facebook pages. I'm a huge believer in this. Add everyone you've met here. You're free to add me, even! I make all of my authors get facebook pages."

As for "tape", the editor said that whenever she's pitching a book to their editors' weekly roundtables, she always gets asked "Does the writer have any tape?" In industry-speak this means, does the person have any recording demonstrating their poise in front of a camera/microphone? If so, let's get that book on the market and get that writer on Fox News!

I looked around that room at this point and again noted the average age of participants was a good fifteen to twenty years beyond my own, and I couldn't help imagining all of these people going home and jumping online to start their facebook pages and jumpstart their careers. They couldn't forget the blog, of course, and anything that can generate page views would help them in the long run.

"Who cares what you write about on your blog. Put a recipe on there!" the editor told us. "People often search the internet for recipes and if you can generate huge page-views, it can only help your case!"

The cynical logic herein was, I must admit, compelling. It's for this reason I've decided to start publishing cookie recipes here.

Welcome to my platform.
