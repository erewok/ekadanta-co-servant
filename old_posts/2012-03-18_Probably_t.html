Had this amazing dream within a dream. I was visiting my uncle's house in the bay area. I took a nap and in the dream had the following awesome dream.

I was about four rows back in the audobon ballroom the night Malcolm X was murdered. In the row immediately in front of me was Ossie Davis. I started talking to him and we were getting along so well and were having the most awesome intellectual conversation that when the guy next to me stood up, yelled something about Islam, and then started shooting at Malcolm x and Malcolm's head exploded, Ossie and I noticed the moment and went back to our engrossing conversation. 

I woke up in the dream wondering what we were talking about and really disappointed that it wasn't real life and that I didn't really meet Ossie Davis. Then I went to a restaurant with my uncle and family.

Then I woke up again, thinking about how crazy it was that I was almost going to see Malcolm x speak and that I had also met Ossie Davis.
