I have decided that someone must review all the product reviews on the internet. How are we to know what is a good review or a bad review? Only the review reviewer can tell us.

For instance, here is a review of the Copco 2510-9963 Acadia Reusable To-Go Mug, 16-Ounce Capacity:



<blockquote>I just received this as an Easter gift and had to come rave about it. This is my new favorite travel mug. Like other reviewers have said, it doesn't have a plastic smell, which is a big plus. The cap twists on tightly and has an inside rubber seal to prevent leakage. Surprisingly, even though the inside is white, it hasn't become stained by my coffee (I've used it for 3 days and haven't run through the dishwasher, just rinsed in the sink). The grip is comfortable. It keeps my coffee warm for hours and doesn't become too hot to hold, like many other travel mugs. Plus, it is the right size to fit in a car cupholder.</blockquote>



My review of the review: I give this review 2.5 stars. The reviewer came back to Amazon too early to review the cup. 3 days? This is much too early to know if the travel mug will be stained or if the grip will remain comfortable. In addition, it may be difficult to clean after sometime and may begin to smell a bit. Indeed, this review could have easily earned a 4 or even 4.25 star rating if the reviewer had only waited a little bit longer and if the reviewer had truly illustrated the pitfalls and perils of owning this Reusable To-Go Mug. Review's Rating: 2.5 stars.

Review Number 2: Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum, 71B
Here's a common problem with Amazon reviews, a problem that mysteriously does not appear on other consumer sites: EVERYBODY LOVES EVERYTHING WAY TOO MUCH! 

There's no way this many people really think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eureka-71B-Hand-Held-Vacuum/dp/B0006HUYGM/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1310966356&sr=1-1">this little vacuum</a> is this great, for instance:  

Tip-offs: 
1) All of these reviews are positive.
2) All of them use complex sentence structure that sounds like marketing speech (exhibit A: "Two cats and two fabric-covered couches, can you feel my pain? After a while, I was going nuts...")
3. All of these reviews sound like they were written by the same reviewer.

Conclusion: Thank you, vacuum-maker, for paying one or a few of your employees to poison the Amazon well. You have degraded our culture in the process and corroded the fabric of our society, the ultimate freedom of which rests on the true and unbiased product reviews of the people.
