Day two of the SDSU Writer's conference started for me with a short conversation with a literary agent who thought my project "sounds a little more literary" than the genre I'd initially pegged it for (mystery).

When I asked what that meant, the answer was that for genre fiction "someone usually dies on the first page."

Genre fiction usually stalks the bookshelfs under its shadow category "downmarket fiction" and at first glance having your project called "literary" might seem a compliment, but depending on the literary agent it could also mean anything from "I'm not interested in this" to "I can't sell this" to "This will never be sold anywhere outside of your favorite coffee shop."

The point is that literary or "upmarket" fiction not only doesn't sell as well as genre fiction (and also doesn't command the huge advances successful genre writers can pull down), but the marketplace again becomes the most important critic of a work.

Towards the end of that second day at the conference, however, I had another conversation with an editor and she liked the pacing and the voice of my piece and in response to the question of its literary merit, she opined "why not just call it a mystery?" In other words, it was good enough for her to throw in with the genres (except that someone still had to die on the first page).

So what to do? Exiled to the upmarket with an invitation to come down, I was faced with a new question: how to sell my project?

This question was finally answered on the third day when another agent said to an audience, "Why should you care if your book sells a hundred thousand copies? In fact, you should probably be insulted if it does."

When I checked I discovered the agent presenting handles (you guessed it) literary fiction. After that I realized something: my book had found a home.
