I love a good internet backlash as much as the next guy, but something about what has been going on over at the <a href="http://blog.hulu.com/2009/2/18/doing-hard-things">Hulu Blog</a> for the past couple of days tickles me in a way that an internet outrage campaign has never done before.

If you're confused by what the bruhaha is about, here's the short version. Hulu (which recently aired a Superbowl Ad to promote its services) is a new internet phenomenon whereby the site's visitors can watch and view high-quality television shows that comeÂ  from NBC (due to the Hulu NBC partnership) and other affiliate channels. This is all well and good, but for many it's not very fun (or comfortable) to watch an hour-long episode of <em>Alf</em> or <em>30 Rock </em>at a desk chair in front of a computer.

A coinciding trend in the hardware world has been to build media center boxes (blogged about <a href="http://erikaker.com/?p=53">here at the Schreibmaschine</a>), which are fully capable computers that are plugged directly into television sets, so one can stream content available online from the couch.

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-107" title="xbox" src="http://erikaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/xbox-300x225.jpg" alt="xbox" width="240" height="180" />One of the new, free, and popular operating systems for these media centers is Boxee, which has been programmed with an easy interface (so you can use a remote instead of a keyboard) and with easy buttons for when you want to see a netflix film, watch some youtube crap, or view some television shows posted legally on Hulu (in addition to a variety of other services). Boxee was built on the foundation of XBMC (Xbox Media Center), which is what we use at my house.

Now, Boxee and Hulu appeared to have a perfect marriage going. This system had been working so well, in fact, that in the past three months Hulu and Boxee have been mentioned together all over the place and Boxee even generated <a href="http://blog.boxee.tv/2009/02/18/the-hulu-situation/">over 100,000 streams for Hulu last week alone</a>, according to the Boxee blog.

All that came to an end this week, however, as Hulu officially mandated no more support for Boxee (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/gigaom/media/2009_02_18_say_goodbye_to_hulu_on_boxee.html">article</a>). The argument was that Hulu's "content providers" had specially requested that Hulu end all service on Boxee or they would cut off their content, so Hulu had to oblige in order to continue serving that content at all. Hulu annouced the decision on their blog under a blog posting titled "Doing Hard Things," while Boxee announced it under a similar posting titled "The Hulu Situation."

What was great about this (until today, actually) were the huge volume of comments that were posted within 48 hours to the Hulu blog. The actual numbers were approaching 500 comments, last I looked, but as of today those numbers are down to 100 due to some heavy-handed editing of perhaps the more embarassing comments (more on this in a second). The Boxee blog posting has, for its part, a good 500 comments, and the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5156151/hulu-blocks-boxee-tvcom-kicks-early-adopters-in-the-face">lifehacker piece </a>on this has about a hundred comments (and 22,000 page views).

As for those comments that made this an interesting story, a large majority of those posted to the Hulu blog (I was disappointed in the situation, so I honestly read all of them) were written by people who claimed they were going to immediately go back to pirating everything in response to the situation. They were utterly outraged by what they saw as an absurd and fruitless response by content-providers to something that did not appear to threaten their revenue streams.

At first, it is puzzling to consider. Hulu has advertisements within its content, so viewers who watch Hulu content on a television connected to a Boxee computer are still seeing the advertisements that a visitor to Hulu's site would see within a browser. In other words, a viewer is still seeing ads, which presumably generate some revenue for the content providers.

A simpler way of thinking about this is that one could install a different operating system on one's media center box, and with the internet browser (firefox, for instance) on that system, one could navigate to Hulu and still get all the content that Boxee users are now cut off from.

To be sure, there are a few absurdities, but there's also some subtle stuff going on here. To understand the position, we have to actually understand the revenue streams of the networks. It may seem counterintuitive, but <a href="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/cablenetwork/cablenetwork.htm">most of the revenue generated by cable networks comes directly from the cable companies</a>, who pay the networks a particular rate (usually between 3 and 25 cents) per subscriber per month. They do generate revenue from advertising, but it's nothing compared to the deal they've got with the cable companies, so the networks stand to lose a great deal of money from those people who said, "Wow, I get the three shows I like to watch via Hulu? Why do I need cable?"

This is actually what a number of posters to the Hulu blog reported, that they had canceled their cable subscriptions because they were no longer necessary. Other posters saw this as an attempt to stem <a href="http://blog.hulu.com/2009/2/18/doing-hard-things#comment-7625">the inveitable tide of technology</a>.While a large majority requested that the invisible "content providers" mentioned in the blog posting be named so they could receive the flood of hate mail brewing for them over at the Hulu blog. None of this beats those who simply stated outright that they were "going to go back to pirating everything," which is an inane threat that reveals something interesting about pirates: they would rather have easy, legal access to content.

In short, cable television packages have been obviated by the internet, and by something consumers have requested for a long time, choice. Many consumers see no reason to pay for the panopoly of crap they get with a cable television package when they can get just what they want for "free" from the internet.

Still, it's not every day you read 800 individual comments where people are so pissed about a situation that they're threatening piracy as the only equitable response.
