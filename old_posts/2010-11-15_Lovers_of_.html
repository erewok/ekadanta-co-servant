I have a few friends from Europe and the UK and every time the wheel of US politics spins around again to election season, I find I have an international interlocutor antagonizing me with a tough question: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8474611.stm">why do the US poor so often vote against their own interests</a>? In other words, why do the poor vote for Republicans who perpetually promise to fight universal healthcare, to cut taxes for rich people, and to cut social programs that presumably benefit poor voters? (This question, of course, is the premise of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-Kansas-Conservatives-America/dp/0805073396">Thomas Frank's oft-referenced book</a>.)

It's a controversial topic in this country, and for some even asking it smacks of elitism for presuming to speak for poor people and for presuming to know what their interests are. For others, it is <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2010/02/why_do_people_w.html">simply incorrect to state that the US poor vote overwhelmingly Republican and therefore against their own interests.</a> I'm going to leave those discussions for others and assume for a moment that it is true that poor people in this country vote for representatives who will little represent them.

Now, these Europeans I know do not necessarily come from more enlightened societies (otherwise <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/8132588/Defiant-Silvio-Berlusconi-claims-Italians-are-still-behind-him.html">Berlusconi</a> would never be elected), but their sense of the political measuring rod of "the left" and "the right," the natural political positions of the poor and the rich, respectively, is what tends to inform the question, "Why do the poor in this country vote against their interests?"

To be fair, the question is overly simplistic. It does have a compelling kernel, however, in that it offers an implicit criticism on perspective, and I found an illustration of this perspective today in <em>Don Quixote</em>.

Early in the second part of <em>Don Quixote</em>, Sancho Panza and Don Quixote are discussing sallying forth again to seek more adventures (and the reason given for this, amazingly enough, is so that the second book can be written). In preparation for this, Sancho returns home and enters into an argument with his wife on the purpose of his squires errantry. Teresa Panza sees it as a useless effort, while Sancho, thinking of the island he's been "promised" sees it as an expedient way to secure the future wealth of his children because he will have the opportunity, for instance, of marrying his daughter to an aristocrat.

His wife responds that it is naive to wish to elevate their children to a station they're uncomfortable within and for which they're ill prepared. To this, Sancho responds that she won't complain when she's enjoying her future wealth and sitting "in the church with velvet cushions, carpets, and tapestries in spite of the best gentlewomen of the parish" (499). 

Teresa then states that she'd rather their daughter married one of their neighbor's sons and she goes on to say, 
<blockquote>But, what you please: make her a duchess or a princess; but I can tell you, it shall never be with my goodwill or consent. I was always a lover of equality, and cannot abide to see folks taking state upon themselves. (499)</blockquote>

The great irony of this comment stems from her claim to be a lover of equality, which is then used to justify the social hierarchy that separates rich from poor, a hierarchy predicated on inequality. 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zacha/228267968/" title="Quixote 1 by Zacha Rosen, on Flickr"><img class="alignright size-medium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/75/228267968_d14c53f351.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Quixote 1" /></a>

At stake here are two ways of thinking about wealth. Sancho's seemingly more modern idea of wealth assumes that social class is fluid. By contrast, Teresa Panza's idea of wealth is static; she sees the category as self-justifying, an assumption that the aristocracy traditionally relied upon to perpetuate the hierarchy that favored them. For Teresa, then, elevating a poor person like Sancho Panza to a station of wealth in contravention to the usual process by which a person enters the aristocracy is unnatural and unfair. 

In fact, her idea of "equality" could be interpreted in a few ways: the poor, as they are, are equal and so elevating one person unfairly is a kind of inequality; alternately, a poor person may not be "equal" to the station of the aristocrat in the simple sense of not being very good at passing for a rich person. Even more absurdly, there is a kind of stasis or equality present in the status quo and merely upsetting that status quo is a kind of inequality. Taken to its logical endpoint, then, no one enters or leaves the social class he/she was born into.

More generally, the discussion between the husband and wife exposes the tortured process by which one is expected to ascend to the upper class, if at all, coupled with the cultural expectation that such social climbing is impossible. This expectation is further paired, in the voice of Sancho Panza, with the tantalizing proposition that perhaps it just might be possible. 

When looking at American politics, I don't think it's unfair to presume that conservatives would without cynicism offer "equality" as their political motivation, after all the free marketers often use metaphors that rely implicitly on a sense of basic economic equality, as evidenced by the phrases "a rising tide lifts all boats," and "leveling the playing field." Even the phrase "free market" implies a kind of openness and fundamentally equal exchange.

Further, this emphasis on equality is likely to be a perspective that appeals to the poor because it, for instance, reaffirms the possibility of the American Dream, even if it simultaneously dashes it to pieces. 

Overall there are complicated perspectives bound up in this hunt for equality and thus those who have convinced themselves they are "lovers of equality", as Teresa Panza has, are perfectly comfortable with a status quo that rests on inequality.
