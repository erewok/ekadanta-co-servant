This is true. This is the dream I had. We were standing around a pool in a small group of people on a college campus. Four of the people around the pool said they were going to run for re-election and others applauded their decisions. This prompted me to think about my own job status and I hit upon an idea I told my uncle about. 

"I should become a religious leader, a priest or minister or something," I said. "I would be really good that." 

He agreed I would be good at it. 

Still, the idea didn't truly appeal to me. It seemed too stifling as a career. Then I came up with a new idea. 

"I should become a sex cult leader," I said to my wife. "I will convince people to have sex with us in order to unlock an all-powerful inner spirit."

I even came up with a name for the spirit.

She agreed this was a good idea.
