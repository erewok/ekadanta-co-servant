At any rate, Andy's carbon guilt tends to appear most on the days when he deems it necessary to drive from surf break to surf break in order to find the one that satisfies the golden ratio: an inversely proportional relationship of crowd-size to wave-size. In other words, he feels worst when he's anticipating the enjoyment about to be received by his decidedly unenvironmentally friendly hobby.

Well, today, a new Carlsbad car company announced a solution for people like Andy. According to an article <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/12/17/aptera_s_sub_30k_300_mpg_car_will_be_here_in_2009/">published</a> at Tom's Hardware, Aptera Motors will have a fully electric vehicle on the market by the end of 2008 that should sell for under $30,000.  Additionally, the fuel-electric hybrid they're working on for 2009 should get a fuel-economy of 300 mpg (which almost turns that ugly euphemism into a viably useful term for us lay people out here in the unmarketable world). Here's the kicker: that UFO fits two 7-foot surfboards, which is more than enough space for Andy to fit his obsession into.

Who knows if this is some kind of  elaborate internet hoax (check out the pictures to see what I'm talking about). It does have a kind of tangible optimism to it, however, and that's what's interesting.
