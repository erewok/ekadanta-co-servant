I was driving an old fiat and a saint Bernard was in the passenger seat. The premise of the dream was that we were going to a hair salon to be paid for some experimental treatment. The saint Bernard sat upright and talked to me, he was a friend, but I don't know his name. Then there was a lot of chasing at drum banging at the salon. They were involved in some egeregious experiment. Once they were done with my friend they had removed his tail, trying to "humanize" him. We got back to the car and found we had three parking tickets. This was the thing that discouraged me most of all.

In fact, I was so relieved when I woke up to discover those parking tickets weren't real.
