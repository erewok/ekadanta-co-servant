Today I've been reading a book recommended by Paul K Dayton, a researcher at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and friend of our family. The book is called <em>Sea of Cortez</em> and records the journey of John Steinbeck and his buddy Edward Ricketts, a name that is familiar in our house as the co-author of <em>Between Pacific Tides</em>.

If tide-pooling is the religion of our family, then <em>Between Pacific Tides</em> is our new testament, the splendidly tide-zone organized compendium of all tidal creatures on the Eastern Pacific. It is a great book, mostly because it lovingly details creatures we love and respect and it does so with a healthy amount of humor and humanity, mixing recipes with recommendations and leaving out as much stuffy scientific pedantry as is possible. <em>Between Pacific Tides</em> is for me like John Coltrane, I don't remember what my life was like before discovering its art, and I do not care to. Now I see the same world I saw before, but I see it with eyes refreshed by the freshness of the work.

With this attitude, I was eager to take on <em>Sea of Cortez</em>. The book was a commercial failure and it is not hard to see why. The first 272 pages are ruminations that seem to come mostly in the voice and philosophy of John Steinbeck, mixed with a lot of the humor and the scientific perspective of Ricketts, all of this in the form of travel writing similar in spirit but far less bombastic than H.M Tomlinson's <em>the Sea and the Jungle</em>.

Midway through, the travel summary ends, and then the reader discovers 30 pages of black-and-white drawings of the species discovered on the trip, followed by Ricketts' discussion of the pair's collection and preservation methods, a bibliography, and finally a complete species list of everything they encountered and a glossary!

What a weird book: science and travel writing? It's oddly ambitious not the least of which because I can't imagine a contemporary audience exists for such stuff. What human can hold enough sense and interest to wish to read both Steinbeck ruminating about how the moon affects human beings and oscillations and physics while simultaneously finding the Ricketts species list compelling? 

Still, the same sly humor punctuates throughout and makes it a fascinating read, as when Steinbeck and Ricketts have their way with the <em>Coast Guide</em>, which they and the captain of their chartered boat have been using to navigate the Gulf of California.

They write:



<blockquote>We have so often admired the literary style and quality of <em>the Coast Pilot</em> that it might be well here to quote from it. In the first place, the compilers of this book are cynical men. They know that they are writing for morons, that if by any effort their descriptions can be misinterpreted or misunderstood by the reader, that effort will be made. These writers have a contempt for almost everything. They would like an ocean and a coastline unchanging and unchangeable; lights and buoys that do not rust and wash away; winds and storms that come at specified times; and, finally, reasonably intelligent men to read their instructions. They are gratified in none of these desires.</blockquote>



It is exactly this kind of writing that the two friends are railing against, writing that seeks staid permanence and dictionary-like consistency amidst changing circumstances. Moreover, writers working within the constraint of permanence appear to achieve it only by strangling the humor and joie de vivre from their experiences. In other words, only someone without a sense of humor could hope to write with anything resembling permanence about the coastline of the Gulf of California and the docks discovered there in various states of disrepair. 

They get much mileage from the fact, for instance, that the <em>Coast Guide</em> states there will be a light at the end of the dock at the tip of Baja. However, the light is on only when the cannery is running, which means the light stays lit exclusively during the daytime and those docking at night are left to fend for themselves.

Thus, these two have a good appreciation for irony, and they take this to heart in the work. Their admonition seems to be: do not expect the world to be an unchanging place, whether you are engaged in science, art, or politics. As they see it, humor and fun are the only response to our mutable circumstances and for this point, the sea is as great and educational a metaphor as any. 

I plan to take this lesson to heart and to follow along the Ricketts/Steinbeck journey, secretly wishing that I could have accompanied the two friends and hoping as well that they find enough beer and specimens to last them the entire trip.
