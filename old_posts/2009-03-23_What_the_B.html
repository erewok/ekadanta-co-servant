The city of Jaurez on the US-Mexico has been in the news off and on for years for <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1171962">the kidnapping and murder of its young woman</a>, all cases that have gone unsolved. Outside of these grim casualties, violence between and around the drug cartels has escalated ferociously: in 2008 6,000 people were killed in Mexico with <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/02/27/juarez.mexico.violence/index.html">1,600 alone murdered in Juarez</a>. This has all been fodder for many news reports on Mexico and Juarez (including stories this week from NPR, the BBC, the LA Times, etc.) as well as fuel for the recent assertion made by the US Military that Mexico has the potential for a "<a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/newupdated/ci_11444354">rapid and sudden collapse</a>." Even worse, they rank the political instability of Mexico on the same level as Pakistan.

Because of the few border crossings and the relative security condensed into a couple of areas.

More specifically, guns are illegal in Mexico, so any gun violence there is most likely conducted with guns that originated in the United States. On the other hand, the United States is the biggest consumer of drugs around, so the border is the last hurtle for the cartels reaching their customers. Thus, the border represents the place where the war for drugs and guns is most focused. As stated out in a report published today by the<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7959247.stm"> BBC on Juarez</a>,
<blockquote>And while American drug users are still prepared to pay for narcotics, the Mexican drug cartels will be prepared to kill to control the lucrative drugs market. The solution here is far from simple.</blockquote>
It's true that any solution for Mexico will be a complicated one, but there's an implication that creeps into the discussion here that is something the news stories always tend to finish with. This commonly-dropped suggestion often finishes the discussion before it gets started, but the idea is that if the United States supplies Mexican cartels with guns and if the United States is the cartels' best customer, then is our country complicit in the throes of violence and self-destruction that Mexico is undergoing?

Connections are easy to draw, but complicity is another thing. In one aspect, the United States has long been sucking up <a href="http://irps.ucsd.edu/assets/015/8800.pdf">Mexico's work-able population with its labor needs</a> (as large industrialized nations will do). While these workers return huge remittances yearly to keep Mexico's small towns afloat, no one's around in these small towns to be part of the process of development and innovation. Thus, the United States and Mexico are tethered at their problems.

Beyond the connection, it's worth asking the hard questions that the news reports love to hint at: is the United States complicit? This is a difficult question, and it might be more worthwhile to envision potential scenarios (as the US military has done) to see where we would have wanted to step in.

It would certainly be catastrophic to see Mexico descend into "failed state" status, and no doubt we would at that point wish we would have intervened earlier. One worry raised by commentators has been that if Mexico's army is now doing the job of its police,<a href="http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/feb/01/1n1army233143-mexican-militarys-wider-role-questio/?zIndex=46275"> the army itself could become embroiled in the corruption and violence that has already festered within the police</a>. Throughout Mexico there remain little opportunities for employment and a thriving and lucrative drug trade represents attractive opportunities. This temptation is surely available to members of Mexico's military, so there may be some truth to the worry. In addition, if Mexico's military is policing the country, what's to stop military leaders from deciding that the country is heading down the tubes and it might be a good time to step in to control the place?

These are big ifs, but there's no doubting that Mexico in its current state is in trouble. If left alone (by which I mean, if symbiotic relationship that can aggravate these characteristics is left alone), can Mexico can fight its way out of these problems? At the very least, if it's our thirst for drugs that's helping drive civil life in Mexico into an unruly warzone, then perhaps our obligation is to work on our side to control or blunt that thirst.

At any rate, if we did have the opportunity to prevent a failed state, we should surely take that chance rather than allow it to happen and question later whether we should have gotten involved or not. That's the news story I want to see, the one that starts with the question of whether or not we're complicit and what we could be doing about it, not the one that ends with the suggestion and let's it go at that.
