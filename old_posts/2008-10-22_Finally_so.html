Anyone following news about the news over the past few years is probably used to waking up every day and reading stories about newspapers and news organizations all over the country folding, selling out, or collapsing. Well, I myself read some good news in all of this mess of news today: after years of insipid coverage, local television news is <A href="http://www.ktar.com/?sid=977567&nid=6">finally set to die</a>, according to a television news journalist in Washington.</p>

<p>Of course, no offense is meant toward the many amazing journalists who contribute to local television news all over the country, but they're working within a system that produces archaic and pointless journalism, designed around an advertising-driven model that itself often receives derision from venues like <i>The Daily Show</i>. Seriously, does anyone aged less than 50 years take local TV news seriously? At its best, local TV news is tabloid journalism: dumbed-down and insulting attention-gropes toward an amorphous viewing audience ("full story at eleven!"). I guess I'll just have to get my weather reports online from now on.</p>
