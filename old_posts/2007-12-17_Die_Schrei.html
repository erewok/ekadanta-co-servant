The typewriter came only a few days after I ordered it online. It's a terrible typewriter, so if you're looking for one, do not buy an Olivetti entry-level crap model. I love it, however. It works so terribly that I'm forced to type slowly, and in this way I'm forced to think about the words getting stamped onto the page.

Actually, it feels wholly satisfying to smack down the typewriter keys and have the faces of the letters get smashed into the paper. When you finish a page and take it out, on the other side you can see where all the periods are, and you can feel the bumps they make when periods are crushed through the paper.
