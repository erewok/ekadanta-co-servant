Like you probably, I have read a lot of coverage lately on the Higgs-Boson and the giant technical party they're throwing to get it to come out. Personally, in the heaps of coverage for lay people, I still feel like some things have been left out of the picture, so I decided to take a shot at clarifying the stuff.

First up: what is this thing called the "Large Hadron Collider"? The answer is that hidden under downtown Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, there is a Walmart-sized structure known as the Large Hadron Collider. A "hadron" is a less self-effacing, massful particle than others that also have mass but are harder to get a read on, so it's out-and-proud in other words. 

The LHC then, takes these hadrons and slams them together, sort of like a game of chicken with two overfull shopping carts in the aisles of a supermarket. Once these two shopping carts smash into each other, in addition to the cup-o-noodles and boxes of macaroni & cheese flying out of them, one may briefly get a whiff of a subtler idea, the concept that draws all this mass production together. These conceptions are individually referred to as "bosons." They are called this because they do not exist, sort-of like not-credit-worthy applicants don't exist for the straight world: they just pop up now and again to turn scams and steal alcohol. Bosons turn up now and again to ensnare us in their fields. Recap: when you smash the hadrons (shopping carts) you get the bosons (conceptions, regrets) and you get some other crud too, which for purposes of brevity in our treatment we are not interested in. 

Now we may approach the problem of describing a boson-and-its-field. First let us say that a field is infinite and it is based on things that do not exist (in a massy sort of way). Here's the deal: a field is sort of like trying to wade through the volume of noise we are drowned within every election cycle. Critics, commentators, analysts, talking heads. Taken together, they form an immense array of noise, a field of noise. Now, this noise is spoken by supposed human beings but they are not the architects of this noise: they are only its vehicle. Where does the noise come from? This is a physics problem.

As an aside, fields are nice because they multiply our opportunities for metaphor. They are like ocean waves lapping the keel of our boats, or they are like lonely wandering clouds and waving daffodils and stuff. Fields are like all kinds of other things that do not exist, but which affect us, like when you watch a commercial on TV and find yourself unexpectedly broken up about it and suddenly crying because the puppy found a home or something and you are like, "why did that just happen to me?"

Back to the bosons: bosons are proof that the fields exist or that they don't exist particularly. Only physicists can accurately measure the bosons that come from slamming these shopping carts together, and that's because the ideas only surface for the scantest moment in time, and time itself only surfaces in measurable ways after hours of coffee and math puzzles.

So perhaps it is a problem of measuring this flaccid, flexible being known as "time." Does time have a boson? The answer is yes: we know so because we are ensnared in its field.

Anyway, far as I can figure it, the reason why the Higgsy version of this boson is important is that when you are shopping and you feel narcotized and weighed-down by the whole inhumanity of pulling inanimate food-concepts off the shelves, you are really swimming upstream against this thing called the Higgs Field, which exists everywhere inside developed nations and which lulls us to sleep in the great running river of commodity fetishism. This is because Higgs' boson (named after the diminutive powerhouse character of the same name on Magnum P.I.) is the one responsible for making things weighty. If you get to the source of all weights (because 'weight', as it turns out, is also a field), then you can figure out truly which cereal is a better value, not to mention the possibilities for diet drugs.

(Physicists never seem to cop to this but a lot of these ideas come from Immanuel Kant: they are just sampling pieces of the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, sort of like rappers endlessly referencing James Brown.)

Finally, while theorists have talked about this Higgs Field for a long time, they have never approached proving such a boson for it exists, until this recent effort at evaluating the Higgs Boson, which appears to have been successful.

Hold off quoting me on this, however, friends: I am no expert. Whatever scant knowledge I have on the subject has been gleaned by reading a great many newspaper treatments and slamming them together to see which of their noodles stick to the wall. I offer my results for you here as a service for which I require no special gratitude.
