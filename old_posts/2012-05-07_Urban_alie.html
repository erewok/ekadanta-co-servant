Repo Man remains a compelling movie for me mostly because after two decades of viewing, it continues to offer interpretive possibilities, taking a form similar to some college kid's all-night rap session fueled by paranoia, youthful nihilism, and caffeine.

Set in a version of Los Angeles comparably apocalyptic to the environment occupied by the Road Warrior, Repo Man tells the story of Otto, a "white suburban punk" from the lower middle class neighborhood of Edge City.

Otto lives in an environment encompassed by a metaphysical vacuum: all religious leaders are fakes (such as the televangelist Otto's parents watch on television, a man who later comes to exorcise a car and fails, flinging down his gold-leaf bubble and uttering a silly  expletive), and the only government that exists is represented by imperious or stoogey cops and some secret nefarious organization that collects dead transients and tortures those live souls it kidnaps.

Within this environment, Otto faces no other option but to become a "repo man," a kind of sellout car thief working for nameless lenders and banks.  Otto's name and his profession are important because in his world, cars are probably the only thing that continue to have value, both as marks for the repo man and as pieces of social currency and self-worth. One interesting note here, all brands have been conspicuously scrubbed from the film and only generic items are featured, from the "drink" they buy at convenience stores to the "food" from a can Otto eats at his parents' house. The one exception to this rule are the cars, which retain their brand and model names. 

Further, with a shadowy government that exists to cover up aliens, brainwash citizens into drooling idiot consumers and even to participate in clandestine wars and death squads in Latin America (referenced twice, arguably, in the film, once when Guatemalan news footage is happily narrated and secondly when Miller talks about "all these people disappearing in South America"), there is a kind of corruption at root in Otto's society and to participate in that society at all means to participate in destruction, corrosiveness, or parasitism. Such a view is seen in the default way Otto becomes a repo man: he's invited to help Bud get his wife's car "out of this bad neighborhood." When he discovers he has assisted in repossessing the car, he says, "I'm not going to be a repo man. No Way."

"Too late," Marlene the administrator at the car lot says as she hands him cash. "You already are."

Taken altogether with its generic-product jokes, punk rock kids, suburban wasteland, and car repossessors, Repo Man offers an absurdist vision, but as a funny take on LA and/or southern california, it manages to ask pointedly "What is there to believe in here?" Ultimately, as Otto is invited into the alien car at the film's close, he rejects the world of LA and the failed society there, and so in a way the film offers a pretty viciously nihilistic answer: "nothing."

"Nothing" is the answer because all traditional systems of meaning, aside from religion and government, are revealed by film's end to be false as well. For instance, Bud, Otto's mentor, is a conservative Archie-bunker type. He believes in "the rules" and he rails at length about how credit is "the foundation of our society." When he charges that the homeless people he sees on the street should be rounded up so "We can see what the fuckers owe," Otto says, "They're bums. They don't have anything." Then, after a comment about the Soviet Union, Otto responds to Bud "They don't have any bills in Russia. Everything's free," to which an incredulous Bud yells, "What are you, a commie? I don't want any commies in my car."

Otto's parents meanwhile are former hippies, stoned and useless at home, watching their televangelist preacher like placid supplicants. They've given away the money they stored for Otto's college fund so they can "send Bibles to Costa Rica." Otto's parents are possibly the creepiest aspect of the film because they never manage to pull their eyes from the TV and look at each other or their son. Thus, while Otto's mentor Bud works all hours on speed as a repo man, Otto's hippie parents are functionally useless. These political archetypes then, liberal and conservative, stand as non-answers to the vacuum of meaning that exists in Otto's world.

Thus, another tool for interpreting meaning in our culture, that of banal, unrealistic, and artificial political tropes, has been disarmed. Otto doesn't even get anything of his "relationship" with his girlfriend, with whom he shares maybe two dates and who tortures him and then tries to guilt him into staying at the end of the film with the line, "What about our relationship?" 

Otto justifiably responds, "Fuck that," to which the girlfriend says, "I'm glad I tortured you!"

All of this nihilism is a pretty good summation of the social outlook of the 80s punk rocker and I think its comprehensive negativity combined with the humor is a good explanation for the film's success. But the weirdest part about <em>Repo Man</em> is that its perspective is wrapped up in a bizarrely B-movie sci-fi plot about some aliens in the back of a car. These dead alien bodies incinerate anyone who opens the trunk of the car but there is no momentum to their conflict in the plot. Where do the aliens need to go? Why are they there? What are we learning from the fact that there are aliens in the car?

The aliens exist in order to set Otto free from his meaningless culture. At the end of the film, he gets in the car and flies away, the only meaningful answer in this environment. The movie remains relevant in that the criticisms it offers, exposing traditional sources of meaning (religion, politics, consumption) within our culture as rootless, is itself a relevant criticism. Of course, Otto's fantastical answer won't work for us so we're left at the end learning how to offer own middle fingers to our society.
