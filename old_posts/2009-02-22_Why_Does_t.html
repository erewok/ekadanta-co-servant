It's entirely possible that in another twenty years we'll be remembering the inane Pirate Bay Trial in Sweden as we remember other seminal trials that have demarcated impending cultural crossroads, such as the trial of the Chicago 7. There are important lines being drawn here, not the least of which comes out of a huge generation gap granted to us by the internet.

Now, by all accounts those dudes at the Pirate Bay <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/02/pirate-bay-we-dont-know-nothin-about-org-charts-contracts.ars">couldn't care less</a> about the legal proceedings against them, but their trial continues to have ramifications for how the rest of us think about media sharing, a philosophical problem that rarely gets treated with the weight it deserves.

The first troublesome point that emerges from this discussion is the distinction between property and information. Remember the MPAA's trailers at the beginning of DVDs where they had that music that meth addicts are constantly listening to in their heads while a montage of theft acts was interspersed with statements like, "You wouldn't steal a car..."? In these promo spots, the closing statement was always the same, "Downloading movies is stealing," and the message beneath the ads was a kind of clumsy cultural accusation: "How can you think stealing a car is not okay and stealing a movie is?"

The problem with the reasoning therein was that this hamfisted attempt to link the downloading of media with the theft of physical objects is a failed analogy, not least because the theft of property involves a physically unique object with an obvious monetary value and an obvious owner, all constraints that the downloading of media fails to pass. Because it is ubiquitous, media is not "property" for its modern consumers, and so any attempt to link file-sharing to theft becomes meaningless and absurd.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-124" title="cdcollection" src="http://erikaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/cdcollection-300x225.jpg" alt="cdcollection" width="210" height="158" />Another way of thinking about it is to say that a DVD is an object with a monetary value that eventually has an owner, but the information it contains does not because that information 1) is not physical, 2) is not subject to aging, and 3) once freed from the constraints of its physical medium is so infinitely reproducible as to be valueless. All this gets shortened in the computer revolutionary's mouth to the slogan "Information wants to be free" (which always sounded to me like a way of avoiding responsibility).

(There are, of course, legal definitions regarding intellectual property that apply here, but outside of these there's much to be learned by an examination of these terms within our culture.)

Our philosophical/linguistic discussion gets muddier when we look at the arguments <em>for </em>downloading media. First of all, just because large groups of people engage in an activity, it doesn't make that activity something that a society will eventually decide is right. It may seem obvious, but this small point gets forgotten.

Secondly, these media conglomerates (such as EMI, one of the plaintiffs in the Pirate Bay suit) may be overcharging for their material (a point that frequently shows up in the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2009/02/pirate.html">comments</a> on this story) but it doesn't mean that they should be <em>punished</em> by having their legal rights abrogated.

Thirdly, the idea that the floodgates are open and that anyone standing in the way is trying to drink up the ocean (another frequently made comment--see above) actually strikes me as accurate, but again it avoids the deeper philosophical questions that should occur here: 1) what are we socially responsible for with regards to media, and 2) how does the concept of data "sharing" elide or further this sense of social responsibility?

Space is limited, so I'm going to take somewhat of a leap and posit that the biggest philosophical problem (and one that it's easy to forget in our branded world) is that for modern "consumers", media is not only<em> </em>not property, it's not even a commodity. If we think of iTunes and the selling of songs at 99 cents, for instance, it would be interesting to ask iTunes customers what they think they are really buying and owning. For a short answer, I'm sure they would say "a song," but would they then assume that that song has an<em> actual value</em> of 99 cents? Instead, they probably realize they're paying 99 cents to<em> receive </em>the song, an important difference. In other words, the 99 cent price-tag levies the ease of access with the same access available through different distribution channels. At the heart of it, then, what consumers are paying for with iTunes is a method of distribution.

Once we realize that the content itself is not a commodity for its modern consumers, it becomes obvious why they're so comfortable with illegal file-sharing: they've simply discovered competing distribution channels to access what they want. Those methods of distribution may be illicit, but it would be illogical to convince file-sharers that their shared content is itself illegal.

Indeed, we are a sharing culture. When I was in high school and I brought a tape over to my friend's house and copied it for him, I was "sharing" my music, and I think it would be hard to demonstrate that I was acting in a socially irresponsible way. If I had millions of friends I was sharing with, would I have been acting irresponsibly? What is the number threshold where my irresponsibility comes into existence and is it purely numerical?

This is where it's finally appropriate to talk about the monetizing of content and competition. Usually, this point shows up a lot earlier in the argument, but we do ourselves a disservice by confusing this issue with our previous discussion of what property, theft, and content-sharing really mean. What the large media conglomerates are (what they've always been) are distributors of content, and the argument is that if their revenue streams are threatened, then no content will be distributed anymore.

By way of an example, my wife has this concern that if everyone were to download everything, then there'd be no revenue stream for a show like <em>30 Rock</em>, and the show would disappear.

However, if you look at the revenue streams of large networks like NBC (the "owners" of <em>30 Rock</em>), they make money primarily from the selling of cable subscriptions and advertising. Those cable subscriptions are the method for distributing television programs, but they're really a terrible method, whereby consumers are bullied into buying a whole lot more than they wantd (that's the "100 channels with nothing on" syndrome). Moreover, it's important to remember that when people are watching a show, they're not "buying" the program. They've already bought access to that program in their cable package, but in this case, the paradigms of distribution are so terrible, it's no wonder that the consumers would discover other ways to get what they want.

What content providers must discover is a way to monetize their new distribution channels instead of fighting to preserve the old (failed) distribution channels.

Moreover, from this perspective, file-sharing makes sense. It's a smart move on the part of media consumers, who, already free from any feeling of responsibility to the content, will find easier and less shitty ways to access what they want. This is also why most file-sharing types are happy to grant that the actual producers should be paid out, which the <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/10/15/radiohead-publishers-reveal-in-rainbows-numbers/">Radiohead example</a> offers a flawed but useful test of.

Ultimately, I don't have any predictions, but I think "content creators" sell themselves short when they fail to understand these aspects of the discussion.  It is still possible to monetize the distribution of content and for a successful example of this, one needs only look at the <a href="http://erikaker.com/?p=104">Hulu example</a>. On the other hand, I wouldn't find it so terrible if these bad methods of distribution (cable TV packages, for instance) were overthrown by better ones, even if there is an uncomfortable period of time where little money is invested in producing the content. In other words, I never find myself swayed by the outlandish fear that content itself will evaporate, in part because human societies are heavy content producers and that tendency isn't going anywhere even as our methods of consumption change.
