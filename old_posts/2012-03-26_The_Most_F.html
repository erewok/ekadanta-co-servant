By page 210 of the <em>Sea of Cortez</em>, Ed Ricketts and John Steinbeck are a little over a month into their journey on the Gulf of California, a venture of scientific collection illustrated in their co-authored book named for that body of water. According to the book, they've pulled immense numbers of specimens from the intertidal and the boat must certainly be heavily laden with the dead and preserved creatures at this point.

The ship's captain and crew as well as Steinbeck and Ricketts have by this point all molded into one uniform society because, as they would have it, their scientific journey has been a step outside of the normal cultural parameters. On their small boat they claim to be working in an improved society where tuna fishermen, one famous writer and a scientist are all seemingly engaged in each other's work.

Steinbeck and Ricketts write:


<blockquote>Costume on the <em>Western Flyer</em> had degenerated completely. Shirts were no longer worn, but the big straw hats were necessary. On board we went barefoot, clad only in hats and trunks. It was easy then to jump over the side to freshen up. Our clothes never got dry; the salt deposited in the fibers made them hydroscopic, always drawing the humidity. We washed the dishes in hot salt water, so that little crystals stuck to the plates. It seemed to us that the little salt adhering to the coffee pot made the coffee delicious. We ate fish nearly every day: bonito, dolphin, sierra, red snappers. We made thousands of big fat biscuits, hot and unhealthful. Twice a week Sparky created his magnificent spaghetti. Unbelievable amounts of coffee were consumed. One of our party made some lemon pies, but the quarreling grew bitter over them; the thievery, the suspicious favoritism, the vulgar traits of selfishness and perfidy those pies brought out saddened all of us. And when one of us who, from being the most learned should have been the most self-controlled, took to hiding pie in his bed and munching it secretly when the lights were out, we decided there must be no more lemon pie. Character was crumbling, and the law of the fang was too close to us.</blockquote>


The writing here is an example of the "we" that the narration employs throughout to describe virtually every activity. This first-person plural is used partly to imply a break-down of social hierarchy, revealing moments where all participants are equal. There is a danger, in fact, that the writer and the scientist would become little kings on this trip because they, at the very least, organized it, paid for it, and know what the hell the trip is all about. 

Instead, in this passage all are stated to be wearing the same shabby costume: shorts and a straw hat. Clothes are the most obvious indicator of social standing, but to hear the pair of authors tell it, a visitor to the boat would have no idea who's crew and who's scientist, and this fact is celebrated as if they've stumbled on a new kind of freedom.

Confusingly, Ricketts and Steinbeck insist on using "we" throughout the book, even in places where it doesn't makes sense. This is their way of ridiculing social hierarchy: all are invited to participate in scientific collection and no one participant is singled out as any more central to the process. All become budding scientists. Such a shared endeavor is espoused, even though, ostensibly everyone is along for the scientific collecting journey of Ed Ricketts. 

What is specially troubling is the comment at the end where the "most learned should have been the most self-controlled." Presumably this is Ricketts, the scientist, and it's an example where the first person plural no longer suffices and one individual is called out. Here the "we" breaks down because of a transgression to the "I": one person stashed and ate lemon pies <em>on his own</em>.

Now, I think the reason they celebrate this "we" so much is that it allows these participants a freedom from the oppression of the "I". There is a relaxed sense to being part of a group. In fact, the most fruitful travel is probably that which allows one to shed oneself. There is a moment of fear where the traveler gives up those parts of his character that seem most central, when the traveler eats bizarre things or engages in cultural practices that would otherwise not be allowed. When I was in India, for instance, I engaged in various Hindu religious ceremonies that I would otherwise have abstained from. We rang bells and poured water on a stone, saying "Om Namah Shivai."  I did this mostly to not be rude to my hosts. Had I been there long enough, however, I may have been converted. Travel requires all kinds of flexibility: culinary, social, even moral. Thus, there is a familiar fear in traveling that runs something like this: "Am I turning into someone else?" This fear emerges alongside the freedom to engage in behaviors the travel otherwise would not engage in. This is, as far as I can tell, what people love about Burning Man.

The scary part of this break-down comes when the individual feels that because certain rules have broken down his own future behavior is unpredictable. In other words, if the standards and ethics that were previously held to be firm have become flexible, does this imply that all standards and ethics are flexible and that given enough time truly horrible things could emerge? 

Steinbeck and Ricketts persistently enjoy the confusion and the disorganized society of the "we" and there seems to be no danger of truly radical social transgression, so the "we" that persists throughout this book exists in order to constantly celebrate the little society they have conjured. However, it certainly leads to other confusions: for instance, who wrote this book?

Authorship is culturally a one-man-show and the narration employed in the <em>Sea of Cortez</em> could be designed to ridicule this concept as well. It's easy to imagine one writer (Steinbeck), and one editor (Ricketts), writing about relativity and the stars and cultural norms that are falling apart, but a few pages after the passage on lemon pies we get this paragraph:


<blockquote>We went first to collect on a bouldery beach on the western side of the bay, and found it fairly rich in fauna. The highest rocks were peopled by anemones, cucumbers, sea-cockroaches and some small porcellanids. There were no Sally Lightfoots visible, in fact not large crabs at all, and only a very few small members of <em>Heliaster</em>. The dominant animal here was a soft marine pulmonate which occurred in millions on and under the rocks. We took several hundred of them. </blockquote>


These chunks of description are littered throughout the text and they read like sections of <em>Between Pacific Tides</em>, Ricketts' phenomenal (and highly readable) compendium of the creatures of the Pacific intertidal zone. Could Steinbeck have come to know the intertidal creatures so intimately at this point that he can sprinkle their scientific names throughout the narration? Both men are listed as authors of the book. Can two people write  a book together (a ridiculous image of one suggesting words over the other's shoulder floats up)?

In fact, this text supposedly originates from a log kept during the journey and when the book failed commercially a revised version with only Steinbeck's name on it was published under the title <em>A Log of the Sea of Cortez</em>. Whose journal was it? Was it a shared journal? This is certainly possible, but for some reason it's hard to imagine: two men sharing a journal? 

The pair must have been aware of the confusion involved and here as elsewhere they rely on the "we" to revel in this confusion. Their implication is that in this zone of activity, "I" truly does not matter, and that focusing upon the "I" results in pernicious behavior, such as squirreling away lemon pies. 

By disregarding the "I" in their narration, they have crafted a discrete society where a fisherman can become a scientist, a scientist can become a writer, and a writer can be crew on a fishing boat. In fact, Ricketts and Steinbeck are not named anywhere in the book: there's not a single "John" or "Ed" to be found. It's like the two friends have wished to be blended into one complete person in order to perpetuate the break-down of their old society and to share in a radically new one. Even above, the implication as to who ate the pies is truly vague: who is the most learned one? The book is loathe to name either of the two men and the above paragraph is as close as they come to directly referencing either one. In this way, they have disappeared into the work.

As could be guessed when a group jettisons the first-person singular, their new society is communal, and among the things that go out the window is authorship, a concept that is toyed with and made confusing. But does it break-down because it's a bad concept or simply because it doesn't apply in this new society? 

I have a two-part theory that may answer this: Steinbeck was such an incredibly famous writer at this point that in the publication of this work his name would have overshadowed Ricketts'. On the author page in my version of the book, for instance, Steinbeck is given 37 lines of text listing various publications and achievements and Ricketts is afforded only four lines at the bottom. Thus, Steinbeck could be giving up his name for his friend in order to let their work stand on its own. In order to give up his name, Steinbeck must purposely confuse the authorship of the book, an endeavor he succeeds in. 

Further, in the Ricketts world, authorship, while important, is not as idealized as in Steinbeck's world. Scientific papers laboriously cite their forebears and often sport multiple authors, sometimes facetiously (<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ix=sea&ie=UTF-8&ion=1#hl=en&output=search&sclient=psy-ab&q=paul%20dayton%20francis%20bacon%20paper&oq=&aq=&aqi=&aql=&gs_l=&pbx=1&fp=5802d2af131e3555&ix=sea&ion=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1024&bih=682">some scientists have named their pets</a> or friends as co-authors on their papers, for instance). Teams of scientists and students are responsible for scientific publications and the work itself is generally more important than the authorship of the work. Scientists give themselves up in the work. Scientific achievement is celebrated and content reigns king while writing style is given little emphasis. Put another way, the work itself is glorified and thus the author is merely one aspect of the work. In Steinbeck's world, it's the opposite: the genius author is glorified above the work. 

Thus, Ricketts and Steinbeck appear to be insisting that the work is collective, that the scientist and the Nobel-winning author are on par, and that work should be thought of as collectively authored because it is the work itself that is interesting. They revel in the confusion this confusion of authorship causes and the possibilities for meaning that ensue.

Ultimately, in their version of society, science is social and texts are social, and difficult though it might be to imagine, there may be some truth to this idea. Perhaps, then, the world of writers has much to learn from the world of science: do the work communally, claim it as a group effort, and step aside.
