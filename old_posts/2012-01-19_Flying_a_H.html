I was flying a helicopter and the fuel light came on. There was a number over the fuel light that revealed we had six minutes of fuel left.

I had flown low over Pt. Conception to check the surf and I had been telling my passengers, "It's really gnarly to the north and then calm to the south."

Except on this day it was sunny and calm on both sides and right at the point you could see a slug-shaped spit of sand that extended diagonally from the point.

I turned around to go back when I discovered a huge resort village dedicated to baseball.

I had no idea it was there.
