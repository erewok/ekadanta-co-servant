I'm starting a new section here at the Schreibmaschine, in which I'd like to document those crucial conversation-killing statements, made by me or someone else, in order to explore just what went wrong. I issue a lot of these, so it is in my interests to examine them before I lose all of my friends entirely.

We recently got a new microwave at work and none of us could figure out how to work the thing. It appears to turn on only via a mystical combination of button-pressing and exhortations.

After about a week of microwave-operational failure, I had the following conversation with a friend. 

"I read the manual for that goddamn microwave."

"That makes you the official microwave guy at the shop," he responded.

"Except I still don't think I can operate the stupid thing," I said. "I can just quote uselessly from the manual, like Trotsky in meetings with Stalin."
