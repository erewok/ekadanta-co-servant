Content of my review:

I cannot imagine I'd ever read one of these stupid customer reviews and base my decision to buy a book of poetry on that review.

However, if I had never owned Pinsky's the Figured Wheel and if I had never read "the Volume" or that poem about his mother saying she heard Fats Waller playing piano in a mall, or the one about the grandmother, or the amazing one about the epileptic seizure in the store with that great line about "hachures in the brain," which is later called "the dark stubborn current that breathes blood," I would want this review to be written for that earlier me who had not encountered these things.

Me from 15 years ago: buy this book as soon as possible. Don't listen to anybody about it. Just read the damn thing. Read a lot of it. Put it down when it frustrates you. But read the shit out of it. It's got some thinking about language in it that feels very fresh and it speaks in a way that no one else speaks and as such it is able to say things that no one else can say. For these reasons it will mean a lot to you some day and you will still read it after you've already read it a lot of times and the spine on the book is broken.
