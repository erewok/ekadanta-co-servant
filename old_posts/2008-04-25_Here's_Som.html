In a piece of breaking news, a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-shark26apr26,1,2794874.story?track=rss">man was attacked by a shark</a> this morning in Solana Beach while he was swimming with friends, but as I read the story, it struck me that this LA Times piece seems to be exactly the kind of story that will generate a fantastic response. The first clue is in the Scripps Institute's Richard Rosenblatt saying that it was "almost certainly a great white shark."

Beyond the writing, it's funny that the shark still carries such a mythological weight in our communities (likely fueled by film, if that gives any clue as to the power of film to shape a culture and its mythologies) in that a fatal attack like this is nearly instantaneously heard around the surfing community as well as the broader community of San Diego (I was emailed by three people on the story, notified by two others in other ways, and I found the story among the top stories in the Times).

The attention this story has already received is notable and reminiscent of other shark incidents in the last decade. In fact, shark attacks are extremely rare here in Southern California (a number of stories are reporting 1959 as the last known instance f a San Diego attack).

Of course, it's also possible that more and more sharks are out there interacting with <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/la-me-sharkattack2,1,7289403.story">ever greater numbers of swimmers and surfers</a>.
