At his performances Keith Jarrett is notorious for being fidgety and over-sensitive (walking out or threatening to walk out on audiences who allowed such indiscretions as coughing or feet shuffling). He's also apparently fully engaged in his work of piano-mastery. He gets so involved in fact that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=keith%20jarrett&amp;search=Search&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;spell=1">he moans and makes other noises</a> (which can also be heard on his recordings).

The interesting thing, however, is that he only makes these noises when he's playing jazz piano. When he plays classical music, he doesn't make the noises. He certainly didn't when he recorded Bach's <em>Das Wohltemperierte Klavier</em>, from whence the title of this blog has been taken.
