I just had a dream that I single-handedly won our first game while playing for my girls high school water polo team.

The team I was on was all white girls and we were playing a black mens' team from another high school. The girls on my team were terrible and I had to be the entire defense and score all the goals.

I woke up with the empowered feeling that I should really take up water polo.
