In the dream we were in a specialty store loosely decorated with displays: plates, small books, other things. I was looking for a gift for my uncle Jeff, which was the premise of the dream, and I had picked up three plates with some boring ikea-style patterns on them.

At that point Shanburst came up to me with an unknowable older person and said, "we found the perfect thing for you! It's a Moby Dick belt buckle!"

So I set down my plates to follow them to the place in the store that had the Moby Dick belt buckle.

It was definitely really cool, but there were some problems. For starters, it was a concrete whale about two feet long, at least as long as the front of my waist, so it was pretty big and heavy for a belt buckle. In addition, being a concrete whale sculpture fundamentally, it didn't have much of a belt buckle apparatus, instead having only two metal posts sticking off the side.

"No big deal," the old guy assured me. "We'll just have to get you that style of belt."

The biggest issue outside of how difficult and awkward it would be to wear was that while the back two thirds were pretty accurate sperm whale, the face of the thing had been sculpted buy a guy who'd obviously never seen a whale before. It looked like a gaping catfish with warts all over its mouth.

It was a tough decision, but after standing there for a minute I decided I couldn't buy it, so I went back to find my plates.

But they were gone!
