<p>Reports of racism at McCain/Palin rallies have sprung up a few times in this election season, and the latest appears to be from a rally in Vegas, where the <u>Las Vegas Sun</u> recorded <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/videos/2008/oct/22/983/">some of their supporters</a> doing their straight-talk thing on camera.</p>

<p>Yesterday, on NPR a woman <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96086423">said</a> with a quivering voice, "I'm not a racist, but if Obama gets elected I think there will be chaos." It's great to hear the "I'm not a racist, but..." lead-in come back, which also appears in <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20081024/NEWS15/81024073">this story</a> about a woman who posted articles on her coworkers' desks over the weekend about how Obama was really a "young, black Adolf Hitler."</p><!--more-->
Finally, probably the best inanely racist news story to be inspired by the election is the one of <a href="http://kdka.com/local/attack.McCain.Bloomfield.2.847628.html">the Texas girl who carved a 'B' in her face</a> and then later claimed she was attacked by a mugger at an ATM who saw the McCain sticker on her car (she's a campaign volunteer) and then decided to vandalize her face in the name of his favorite candidate. Have you guessed the mugger's race, yet? Police were suspicious of the girl's story because 1) it kept changing, and 2) the 'B' was backwards.</p>

<p>As a sidenote, there was a story a few weeks back about a guy who posted a sinister-looking photo of Obama on <A href="<a href="http://www.politicalbyline.com/2008/10/13/if-you-came-looking-for-the-enough-posting/ ">his blog</a> to which he added a noose in Photoshop as well as the tagline, "Asphyxiation: The Fucking Solution," and not to belabor the point there, but I was mostly struck in this example by one of the commentators who spouted what seemed to me an odd bit of paranoia: 

<blockquote>Once Obama is elected, and his “CrimeThink” citizen vigilante squads hit the streets, the P.C. 90s will seem like the good old days!'</blockquote></p>

<p>It is most interesting for this fear, a regrettable result of the still maligned and misunderstood concept of "political correctness," to appear here because there is absolutely no substance for linking it to the Obama campaign. As a holdover from the 90s, political correctness emerged from college campuses as a loose campaign to reform corporate and public language. While the intent was to expose hidden assumptions about race, gender, class, sex, etc., conservatives took it to mean some kind of Orwellian de-legitimizing of thought. That fear itself was likely based on a simplistic view of racism (for example) as the conscious dislike of an individual for that individual's race. In this paradigm, it's very easy to tell who is a racist: those guys who were in <u>Mississippi Burning</u>.  On the other hand, a social awareness about race appears to exist at much deeper, much more fundamental levels than in simply conscious thought and action. Thus, for citizens who couldn't remember engaging in any outwardly racist acts, political correctness failed to warn them that our thinking about race often emerges as neuroses about race, not some conscious discriminatory act, and they rebelled against any attempt to reform their thought and speech.

<p>Another common response to the waves of social reform in the PC-90s was to talk about "reverse racism," or racism on the other side, and in the first article posted above a few comments immediately pop up to the effect that large percentages of black voters voting for Obama amounts to "racism." While the criticism surely holds that all white voters who plan to vote for McCain are not racists, the reverse implication for black Obama supporters, that they'll vote entirely on race, that is folded into this criticism <em>is</em> a racist assumption, because it assumes no individuality or critical ability for black voters. A similarly naive commentator notes that:

<blockquote>
I agree with the posters who cite the bias and the free pass that Obamatrons always get. A prime example is that it's now considered trendy and witty to sneer "You betcha" as a way of insulting Gov. Palin by mocking her speech patterns. And that gets no notice or condemnation.

But try mocking Obama just once by saying "Otay!" or "Yo, lemme axe you sumpin'" and see what the response is.</blockquote>
</p>
<p>Assuming for a moment that this comment is sincere, the naivety with which it is produced is amazing, most obviously because parodying the ways in which Obama speaks would involve imitating at the very least the speech patterns of a constitutional law professor from Chicago and not (as this commentator assumes) classic black stereotypes. Still, as far as I can tell, Obama has never mentioned political correctness, and much has been made about his methodical and deliberate avoidance of discussions about race</p>

<p>Thus, the utterly simple (yet astounding) reason why this PC-backlash has showed up this presidential election is because of the race of one of the candidates, and there exists a contingency of voters who envision a brave new world of political-correctness ushered in on an Obama presidency. This is, ultimately, a good example of racism: an assumption that those other types are not afforded individualistic thought but that 1) they're all the same and 2) they're different from me. In other words, there are white voters who are afraid of a black president.</p>

<p>In the end, it seems silly for those who are spouting racist stuff to get so defensive when it's pointed out to them. Why won't they admit to racism instead of mounting this oblique attack on 'political-correctness'? The answer, probably, is that they've been trained that "racism" is bad, but that this training fails to really understand what racism can be.</p>
