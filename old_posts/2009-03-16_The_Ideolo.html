Last week I was invited to attend jury duty, jokingly referred to as a "subpoena" by one friendly judge in order to describe hundreds of people showing up and spending their day in a civicly-minded sort of way.

We future jurors started out in a long line feeding into a metal detector, which fed us into a waiting area with three televisions and thirty rows of chairs. After half an hour, a sallow fellow said, "We're now going to start the video portion of our orientation."

I liked the video. It began with the supposition that, "California is the best and most beautiful state in the union. But not always..." The implication here was that it's not the best and most beautiful state whenever something happens that requires people to report for jury duty.

After our video portion a crusty old judge got up to pep-talk us into feeling inspired about being jurors. He said "We've got a full dance card today, so we're going to need all of you." After that they called us up by name to various floors and various courtrooms in one of two buildings connected by a sky bridge, and I got stuck, as always, in the civil building.

Now the judges and lawyers in this process are the sad people who have to do this each week and they seem to view all the normal people pulled into their universe as audience members at a little-attended circus. When we group of jurors were finally invited into the courtroom, we found a set of lawyers and clients looking nervously upon us as evaluators of their antics. Of course, the lawyers tried hard to smile.

Immediately the jury selection process began, initiated by the judge who asked us whether we felt we could be fair. I said that I wanted to believe I could be fair, but that I remained skeptical of chiropractors in general (one of the parties in the case). This was true and was meant as an honest admission, so I like to think it wasn't merely an attempt to evade jury duty. Reluctant to let anyone go, the judge merely responded that a healthy skepticism is good for any case and we moved on to the lawyers asking questions and eliminating jurors.

It was here that I noticed a trend emerging. A previous trial I was almost selected for was also civil and also involved a plaintiff suing for damages for pain and suffering. In each trial when the two lawyers started asking questions of the jurors, they focused on a political tangent: were any jurors there angry about all "the frivolous lawsuits we hear about these days?"

In the other trial I was thanked and excused from, they went so far as to ask if anyone had heard of tort reform. I raised my hand and the defense went fishing for my real opinion, so I spoke up and said "Whatever anyone says, changing the rules of lawsuits just seems like a really lame way to reform the healthcare system." For that response I was thanked and excused.

In this recent case the lawyers started talking about the McDonald's coffee case. After just about everyone in the jury boxes had decided that the coffee case was egregious and we had moved on to talking more generally about suing for pain and suffering, I spoke up to say "I don't even think that coffee case was illegitimate."

The judge came to my defense at this point, offering details of the case: the coffee was over 200 degrees, the woman was a passenger, not a driver, and she'd received a serious and unexpected burn from her coffee.

Even with the judge's help I was still a marked target for the defense lawyer who wanted to stack the jury with jurors who seethed at the idea of lawsuits. Thus, I was thanked and excused.

I couldn't help but wonder something about the process, though: one's case must be very weak if one's strategy revolves entirely around excusing the jurors who don't like lawsuits. Not only that: it seems disingenuous. By focusing on a political tangent and seeking out jurors who can form a consensus on that tangent these defense lawyers were dismissing (perhaps evading) the details of their cases in favor of a red herring. Civil lawsuits aren't going anywhere; they're a fundamental part of our justice system and it is nothing if not disingenuous to attack the whole system instead of talking about the case.

I wouldn't actually know how these trials go, however, since I never stick around long enough to be on a jury.

Finally, when the judge and his crew have to let you go, they act like when you've told your friends you're too busy to help them move. "Your service is done for the year," says the judge, and they all say thanks and the door closes.

The lesson I've gotten from this is that if you want to be excused from jury service on a civil trial merely proclaim that you have no problem with civil trials and that should be enough to send you home. It's happened to me twice, now, and I'm starting to build a healthy prejudice against the defense lawyers who practice this method of jury selection.
