<p>Doolittle, played by Eddie Murphy, has long since lost interest in his work, a fact which plays out in the disinterested way he interacts with his son and daughter, ages 7 and 5, played by Rick Rachtman and a precocious Amy Poehler. Doolittle rages at his daughter, for instance, for spilling some toxic-looking fruit cereal on his grant application and refuses to attend a baseball game with his son, all of which heavy-handedly establishes one point for the film's scriptwriters: Doolittle, a brilliant zoologist, is a bad dad.</p>

<p>All of this changes, of course, when Doolittle crashes his Mercedes into a bus stop while trying to avoid a rooster in the road (a piece of visual cliche perhaps lost on the young audience for the film) after which he awakes in the hospital. Apparently, certain members of our species are genetically oriented toward animal communication (such as the "whisperer" types omnipresent on television). In Doolittle's case, however, the gift manifests only following a serious head injury which leaves him aphasic (for humans) while the right side of his face is paralyzed, played by Murphy to comic effect. He discovers this when he wakes up in the hospital and finds himself having a psychedelic-leaning conversation with a small bird with a wit for personal insults.</p>

<p>Thus, the tragic irony (and the fundamental conflict in the story) is established early: the great gift of conversing with animals comes at the loss of human communication and half a face. Thus, this rather low-browed film is endowed with a pretty cerebral element, Doolittle is cast as a tragic hero.</p>

<p>Indeed, the most touching moment in the film is when Doolittle, on medical leave and attending a San Francisco Giants game, yearns to express his reawakened love for his children, yet he cannot. For their part, the kids just stare blankly at him with pink sugar on their faces while his failed attempt at communication is internalized. It is the audience that receives his message.</p>

<p>By contrast, the animals he interacts with in the film (who become his confidantes) are poor replacements for human contact. As represented here animals are dimwits, interested mainly in using the gift of language to discuss body functions, food, and, oddly inappropriate for a children's film, sex. The latter is funniest, though because to hear the perverse joy with which a spaniel pines for a borzoi, imagining the means they might resort to to consummate, offers a kind of backwards look at the strange sexual fantasies (as the animals would see it) expressed by humans.</p>

<p>Of course, the ultimate decision presented Doolittle at the end of the film is whether to keep his gift of animal interaction (and all the fart jokes that come along) or return to his family a restored individual, someone gifted with the precious knowledge of the value of having language as well as some simpatico folks to converse with. He opts for invasive brain surgery, which returns his speech and his face and which, by some miracle unexplained by the film, manages to perpetuate his zoolinguistic abilities.</p>

<p>The lesson in all of this is perhaps hidden in one of a variety of hackneyed phrases: be careful what you wish for maybe, or love the ones you're with?</p>

<p>At the very least, the film should give anyone seeking greater communion with animals a little pause: they may turn out to be truly boring to talk to. Plus, even if you can't talk to them, it's still redeeming to be around people whose company you actually enjoy whether they're people or animals. Maybe that's the point: don't waste the language that you have on assholes.</p>
