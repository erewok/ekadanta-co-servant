So this word for memory-devices comes from an old Greek word that sort of means "mindful," and today as I've been looking up medical mnemonics, I was struck by one clever aspect of them: they are designed to be provocative or even partly offensive. In fact, it seems that the more dramatically they can provoke listeners, the more easily they stick on the mind. Here's an example:

<strong>C</strong>yanide <strong>T</strong>astes <strong>L</strong>ike <strong>S</strong>weet<strong> C</strong>andy

<!--more--> This sentence lists off the different sections of the spinal column, Cervical, Thoracic, Lumbar, Sacrum, and Coccyx (which you may remember from<em> Safe Men</em>, when LaFleur the hit man suggests he'll only break the relatively useless Coccyx to get back at Sam, the safe-cracker).

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Another example that comes from my high school physiology class runs like this: "Never Lower Tilly's Pants, GrandMa Might Come Home." It was so nice of my teacher to implant this in my mind so that even to this day I can remember my tarsals, the bones of my ankle: </span><span class="entry-title entry-content">Navicular, Lunate, Triquetral, Pisiform, Greater Multangular, Lesser Multangular, Capitate, Hamate</span><span class="entry-title entry-content">.</span>

There's an equal (but comparatively tame) one for the wrist (the carpals) which share some names with the tarsals: "Scared lovers try positions that they can't handle" for  Scaphoid, Lunate, Triquetral,           Pisiform, Trapezium, Trapezoid, Capitate, Hamate .

You can see how most English speakers would have trouble remembering this string of nouns. Nevertheless, med school students are required to memorize long runs of information and the mnemonics are really one of their own tools for doing so. Probably my favorite of the provocative mnemonics (but there are many many of these and you can browse them at <a href="http://www.medicalmnemonics.com/">medicalmnemonics.com</a>) is this one:

<span class="entry-title entry-content">Oh Oh Oh To Touch And Feel A Goodly Virgin's Ample Hymen 			</span>

This one ticks off the cranial nerves and I couldn't recite them for you because I never learned this one in school. (Here they are, nevertheless: <span class="extiw">olfactory nerve</span>, <span class="extiw">optic nerve</span>, <span class="extiw">occulomotor nerve</span>, <span class="extiw">trochlear nerve</span>, <span class="extiw">trigeminal nerve</span>, <span class="extiw">abducent nerve</span>, <span class="extiw">facial nerve</span>, <span class="extiw">auditory nerve</span>, <span class="extiw">glossopharyngeal nerve</span>, <span class="extiw">vagus nerve</span>, <span class="extiw">spinal accessory nerve</span>, and <span class="extiw">hypoglossal nerve</span>.

Additionally, to figure out whether each of these twelve cranial nerves is sensory, motor, or both, just remember "<strong>S</strong>ome <strong>S</strong>ay <strong>M</strong>arry <strong>M</strong>oney <strong>B</strong>ut <strong>M</strong>y <strong>B</strong>rother <strong>S</strong>ays <strong>B</strong>ig <strong>B</strong>oobs <strong>M</strong>atter <strong>M</strong>ore."

Here's what can be learned from this:Â  if you want to remember units of information, strip all the first letters off the words you want to remember and turn these first letters into a highly offensive or merely provocative sentence and you'll be amazed how it sinks into your brain and plagues you years later until you wonder stuff like "What's the point in continuing to remember the bones of the ankle?"
