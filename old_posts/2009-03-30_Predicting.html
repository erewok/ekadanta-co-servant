I found myself thinking again about the future of music distribution when I picked up a copy of <em>San Diego CityBeat</em> last week and read about <a href="http://www.sdcitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/out_of_obscurity/7870/">Obscure Magpie</a>, the publishing arm of a band here in San Diego called Transfer.

In the article Obscure Magpie is touted as an innovative success story, and there is an attractive model in what they're doing. According to its founder Matt Molarius,
<blockquote>The traditional label deal seems to be obsolete. CD sales are becoming obsolete, which is why the label deal is obsolete. Labels aren’t making any money off their traditional format, which is selling CDs. Everybody’s file sharing; there’s no way to really control it. Nobody really pays for music anymore.</blockquote>
While the story is certainly a little more complicated than the details here, the facts as stated seem obvious. As Ars Technica <a href="http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/03/report-yep-cd-sales-keep-falling-but-new-trends-may-help.ars">reported the other day</a>, music sales went up in 2008 while CD sales plummeted to the tune of 17 million. We've talked about this before and the most obvious guesses should get at why this is the case: CDs do not deliver the convenience of access that electronic files do. It seems, then, that the problem for traditional media companies is figuring out how to monetize these new methods of distribution, <em>not</em> the content itself (an important distinction).

However, even though everyone is file-sharing, Molarius still seems to think there's some value in intellectual property, and he moves on to talk about his band's incentives for licensing stuff for corporate clients:
<blockquote>The license to intellectual property is beyond technology. Music directors, independent film companies, TV shows, marketing companies—all those people need music, and they need the license to use it. Publishing companies own those licenses.</blockquote>
So the next logical step is to start a publishing company to license content to those who will use it for commercial ends, which becomes another way for consumers at the back-end to get that content without paying for it, and here is where something interesting pops up. All of this corporate whinging about there being no money in content-creation anymore is at best a short-sightedness and at worst the death knell of a defunct industry. Media corporations seek methods to preserve their business models, which ultimately involve the selling of stuff to individual consumers at huge profits, but their business models are outdated because people don't want to buy (content-in-its-physical-form) stuff anymore. Thus, smaller firms with smaller staff and less ambitious goals will likely step in take their place, and these firms will be selling mostly intellectual property with a little bit of content on the cheap.

On the consumer side, a good model for how content consumption will look in the future is Apple's App Store for the iPhone and iTouch. At the App Store, consumers buy applications for their devices for mostly between $1 and $5. Some ad-supported applications are even given away free of charge, so not only is the price right, but the model of distribution works (for consumers) and there are millions of applications available for immediate download (<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal_tech/virtualworlds/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=216200191&amp;subSection=News">800 million and counting, actually</a>). What makes this easier is that consumers have a username and a password connected to a credit-card-linked account, and all they need to do is enter this information to make a purchase.

Similarly, when music and book producers find the centralized marketplace they need to sell their wares, the prices for consumers will likely plummet to between $1 and $5, mirroring the low-risk prices we see for applications at the App Store. Some might argue that iTunes already fulfills this purpose, but the competitors who will offer more to content-creators are surely up and coming. This would be true at the App Store too, where application developers receive little help from Apple when they post work there, but Apple faces no competition in the App Store because they're selling only to their own devices. In fact, Apple controls too much of its iTunes marketplace for it to be attractive long-term to content-producers and owners like Molarius who would see no reason not to self-publish and self-distribute. Indeed, they can easily do so on their own websites just like Radiohead, and this, of course, is where the story usually stops for those propagandizing the brave new world of content production and the ownership it surely promises creative types. There are important things still needed for it to work, however:
<ol>
	<li>An open marketplace with an easy buying policy.</li>
	<li>An open device(s).</li>
	<li>A method of promotion, publishing, and licensing.</li>
</ol>
Firstly, the App Store is a great example that helps us see what is possible. For instance, I could spend a year writing a book and then sell it online (assuming it was worth reading) at this website for $1,but it would likely be more valuable to me to compete with my book in a centralized marketplace, and I would happily forfeit a share of the profits in order to be allowed access to a potential audience numbering in the millions. That $1 price tag is not a bad one if I can eliminate a lot of the intermediaries and the costs associated with mass-producing a physical object.

Moreover, consumers at this marketplace would have the luxury of a vast selection and a simple one-click option to buy whatever they wanted at low-risk prices. The bet would be whether enough people would buy my book to make it worthwhile to distribute in this way. If writers were keeping a good portion of the profits (say 50%, with 30% going to the marketplace and 20% going to the company that produces the work), it would be hard to find writers who dislike those odds versus the huge risks and low-rewards associated with traditional publishing, where most of the money is in the big-bet advances offered by publishing companies to their most successful writers. In that last case, publishing companies can always try to recoup their losses from that advance or extort more work from a writer for his/her inflated advance if a work turns out to be less successful than they had guessed, making the relationship even more fraught for the writer. This is mirrored in traditional record-company/artist relationships, where some of the slimiest contracts have ever been authored.

As stated before, what makes the App Store a problematic example for this discussion is that Apple controls the device for which consumers are making purchases. That's why an open device, the second element, is necessary. Future content buyers are going to want to read, listen to, and watch things on whatever device they prefer (whatever the marketplace offers them and there's no shortage of interested competitors), so an open device that can log-on to and acquire content from an open marketplace is absolutely vital to the whole process. Right now and with more surely to come, there are no less than three categories of consumer electronics vying for the right to bring content into people's hands: smart phones, handheld videogames (like the PSP and Nintendo DS), and old-fashioned media devices (and I'm putting the iPod and Amazon's Kindle in here because they don't do anything else sexy except read books and play music). Thus, a variety of devices are on the horizon that will achieve the goal of bringing a huge range of content into consumers hands.

As for number 3, I'm sure a lot of people cringed over my author-selling-his-book-for-$1 example because there's a glaring problem here: I'd need a lot of people to buy my book for $1 and who's going to promote all this stuff? A useful example here (even though it's a site that I find totally abhorrent and eye-gouging) is Myspace. Already a place for bands to promote themselves, it makes sense that the next logical step for a site like Myspace would be publishing and distribution. This again is why Apple's App Store is great for consumers but terrible for content-creators: it allows very little in the ways of traditional promotion and in the end Apple holds all the keys to the castle.

This isn't to say that any of this would be easy. Promoting creative work in competition with millions of other creative works is a daunting task, but it always has been a daunting task and as such it has always been dominated by the most innovative and creative types, people willing to see opportunities in odd places. The internet is nothing if not an example of modern promotion, which I was reminded of recently when my brother-in-law purchased the <em>I Can Haz Cheezburger</em> book.

On the other hand, I know enough musicians here in San Diego who have toured the world in acclaimed bands and who still must keep their day jobs, so I don't think traditional methods are working for them either. They have the promotion, but what they need instead is the licensing, publication, and content-selling on the cheap. If they were to sell their work online, they might even be able to build a direct connection between themselves and the consumers of their work, those people who used to be called "fans". This is the one final attractive element here for a content-producer: with a closer connection to an audience, one might have more trust that sales numbers reflect an actual audience selecting one's work. In publishing for instance, one could write more dutifully for an audience, who can be harsher and more erratic, than for a publishing house, which can be stifling and uncreative because they have only two customers in mind: the dominant book-sellers on the market.

It does seem like the much-touted future is coming within site. We have a variety of corporations that are competing to bring us that future (with Apple a clear winner and power-holder at the moment). Ultimately, all consumers will have to do is select the electronic devices that bring them the most access to what they want, but this is probably what they'll do anyway.
