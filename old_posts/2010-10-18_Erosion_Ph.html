I have no expertise or even real generalized knowledge on this subject, neither do I have much of an opinion, so this is why it would be fitting to allow images to tell the story. Pictured below is what looks to be a large piece of steel-reinforced retaining wall, as well as the cliffside it fell off from.

Up above, there are many structures, some of greater significance than others, that appear to be undergoing the same slow process: erosion of the cliffside which leads to instability and ultimately destruction.

Down below there are a variety of examples of large structures slowly losing their footings and getting dragged out to sea, or at least to sea level. My favorite example was in this surprised-looking piece of wall.

Other pieces had already broken off and fallen forward.

In fact, the entire trail was a footpath of broken-up retaining wall.

I'm not sure what stage of the erosion process is represented in the following image: is this a preventative measure to wick moisture away from the cliff? Is this what lay under the dirt that was swept away?

As someone who has always wanted to live as close to the ocean as possible, I can imagine feeling pretty frustrated by this inevitable process, were my house to be one of those threatened. 
<a href="http://erikaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ErosionIMG_0602.jpg"><img src="http://erikaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ErosionIMG_0602.jpg" alt="" title="ErosionIMG_0602" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-468" /></a>

While the ocean is insatiable and its capacity to erode the coast (and whatever we build upon it) is inexhaustible, it would be easy to to be lulled into believing that the process is so long-term that it won't affect the 30-year mortgage-holder. It even seems benign most of the time, as on a small-swell day at low tide.
<a href="http://erikaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ErosionIMG_0589.jpg"><img src="http://erikaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ErosionIMG_0589.jpg" alt="" title="ErosionIMG_0589" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-459" /></a>

At the same time, the whole process does seem like an obvious result of marine and meteorological forces. I can still hear my Ocean Geography professor from UC Berkeley railing against those who would live on a bluff or cliffside. He called these homeowners many unfriendly names, and his ire stemmed from the fact that by building homes in these areas, they are momentarily attempting to hold back a long-term physical process that simply cannot be prevented. As a fan of the beach, he probably had the thought too that preserving these views and areas only for those wealthy enough to buy property in front of them is an affront to all coastal citizens. This is the argument I've heard made by the Surfrider Foundation, for instance, which lobbies to protect coastal access for the public.

All human structures are temporary, but here the lesson appears to be that all structures on or near the ocean are much more temporary than we are likely comfortable with. The ocean itself builds beautiful structures that it will eventually tear down.
<a href="http://erikaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ErosionIMG_0613.jpg"><img src="http://erikaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ErosionIMG_0613.jpg" alt="" title="ErosionIMG_0613" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-471" /></a>

We build our environment in linear ways because these are the structures deemed most durable to us, but a simple tour of the coastline is enough to challenge these notions of durability. Perhaps we'd be wiser to think of our homes as temporary dwellings, as the octopus likely does when it seeks out a commodious cubby like the following.
<a href="http://erikaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ErosionIMG_0605.jpg"><img src="http://erikaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ErosionIMG_0605.jpg" alt="" title="ErosionIMG_0605" width="719" height="539" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-470" /></a>
(I was disappointed in my effort to find an octopus in there. I really thought it would be the perfect spot to see one, so I looked for awhile.)

At any rate, its difficult to think of our dwellings as transitory, and this is why those who can will likely continue to build houses right up to the coastline, and the coastline will continue to eat their efforts. 

As obvious as it is, this does not appear to be a lesson we'll be learning anytime soon. Further, with the premium on coastal real estate, market forces will prevent us from learning the lesson for as long as possible, or at least until all of these houses fall into the sea and we have a new coastline on which to build our impermanent structures.
