Two articles in the tech news world today illustrate the computer tools available to the average Joe:

1) Creepy, a new application that <a href="http://www.thinq.co.uk/2011/3/30/creepy-app-warns-end-privacy/">allows you to stalk others</a> (or yourself if you are so inclined), and

2) Some obsessive dude <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/03/30/vbs.atomic.trucker/">built his own Atomic bomb</a> and published the results online.

Interesting thing that popped up on the latter: if you spent much of your life building an atomic bomb, wouldn't you really really want to test it out?
