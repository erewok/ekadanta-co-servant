<p>The show is definitely a head-scratcher and there are all kinds of tech terms we could throw at it (I keep thinking, and I mean this even as a compliment even though I don't care for his work at all, that it's a show Thomas Pynchon would love), but the general feel and tone of the show is one of a romp through fun times and mind-benders without concern for the full-blooded ramifications of these fun-times and mind-benders (you see what I mean about Pynchon?). In other words, it's smart without being smarmy or interested in its own smart-ness. It's fun first and only smart when being smart <em>also happens to be fun</em>.</p>

<p>One of the funny things about the show is that at the end of each of their twelve minutes, after fighting demon beasts or rescuing odd-ball princesses (or being rescued by them), Jake and Finn, the two main characters, often take a moment to reflect on "the lesson". "What's the lesson here?" they ask rhetorically and then they try to figure out what the lesson is supposed to be, as if they're quizzing the god-author figure directly.</p>

<p>For instance, in an episode late in the first season, Finn is turned into a giant foot by a Magic Man and he must rally the other sad sack lumps who have also been turned into body parts to coordinate their activities and fight the Magic Man. As they're battling the Magic Man, Finn demands his body be turned back into human boy form.</p>

<p>"Why should I?" Magic Man responds, "You still act like a hero only so you can get what you want." At this moment, it sounds like we're veering dangerously close to a "lesson", something that will steer our heroes toward 'proper' and 'correct' behavior, which the traditional-minded Finn is trained to pick up on:</p>
<blockquote>Finn: Oh. You were trying to teach us to be kind without expecting anything in return. I shouldâ€™ve given you that sugar cube without even thinking about a reward.

Magic Man: Wrong! [Hurls magic at them again. It hits Finn in the face]</blockquote>
<p>Finally, after Finn says, "I wish I'd never been nice to you 'cause you're just a big jerk!" the Magic Man tells him that's the lesson and then he turns him back and flies off to "spread [his] teachings to more sissy do-gooders".</p>

<p>The "lesson" seems to be that some people are just assholes, which is interesting in that it's really gray-area for a boy who spends his days playing and thinking about vanquishing evil with his buddy, Jake the dog. In truth, it's a bit too cynical for someone who wants to believe that good and evil exist, but who perpetually finds evidence instead that general okay-ness and assholish-ness exist, and that these are the true oeuvre of human behavior. Still, they're not really satisfied by this lesson imposed by the Magic Man and Finn and Jake take a moment to reflect after he leaves.</p>

<p>"Wait, so, what was the lesson we just learned?" Finn asks his buddy.</p>
<p>"Maybe it was, don't give your sugar to jerks," Jake responds.</p>

<p>This little moment of meta at the end of their programs strikes right at the heart of a well-known and universally hated attribute of children's shows: they're often trying to teach some bullshit life-lesson that is so fraught with ambiguity that it falls apart anytime one tries to apply it. Imagine all the kids' shows and movies you've ever watched and you can render up in the brain a sickeningly boring parade of life lessons that are really just useless platitudes. Usually those kids' show cliches are so dumb as to be downright insulting: no one imagines, and kids are never permanently deceived into thinking, that the world can be categorized and divided up simply into correct and incorrect behavior. Knowing what to do in a situation is complicated and pretty much the whole art of human socialization. Now, take your doubts about the uselessness and cliche of life lessons and imagine trying to write an episode for a kids' program where the 'lesson' is "some people are just assholes" and you will start to get a feel for how <em>Adventure Time</em> works.</p>

<p>More broadly, the show celebrates ambiguity in a variety of ways. It is set in a loosely defined world that seems to takes its rules from the capabilities of imagination: the Bubblegum Princess rides around on a laser-spitting goose and giant worms pop up and sometimes a knife storm arrives. Very few tropes are used again from one episode to the next and the show exploits a kind of endless possibility.</p>

<p>For instance, in one bizarre episode the vampire queen, Marceline, dupes Finn into being her lifelong henchmen and for the rest of the episode she tortures him by putting him in compromised situations, commanding him to murder cute-seeming plants and raise armies of the undead to raid castles. The Vampire Queen plays this older sister role: she's really a confusing girl, but she appears to be, in the first season at the least, the only sexually aware being, with her hip jeans and haircut. Finn kind of likes her but he's also a bit afraid of her and she represents dangerous and unpredictable possibilities.</p>

<p>And in fact many of the creatures and friends in the show exhibit this strange doubling quality of being friendly and cuddly while also dangerous and scary. As viewers we learn to watch the show for the switching back-and-forth, the moment when the bad guys who want to rend their flesh sometimes really just like to wrestle a lot. The humor often erupts from the switching, the surprise and absurdity.</p>

<p>The only somewhat predictable element is the main character, good-guy Finn, who seeks black-and-white dynamics within his bizarre and unpredictable world. If this in itself isn't a beautiful analogy for childhood, I don't know another one. Adults are often telling children how to act and children often <em>want</em> there to be simple, fundamental rules for proper action (possibly because they want to believe these authority figures), and yet the environment of the child rarely presents moments where these rules can be applied. Thus, the desire for black-and-white represents a kind of sublimated desire for correctness, for truth, as well as a wish for leisure: it's hard work thinking about what the right things to say and do are!</p>

<p>While Finn, who finds his raison d'etre in adventuring, often expects to encounter binary opposition, Jake the dog, meanwhile, who can participate in magic and who has the somewhat cynical attitude of an older brother (he's older than Finn in show logic; he's interested in girls), appears to be a bit more comfortable with the loose possibilities of meaning.</p>

<p>In one episode where the two main characters try to cover up a misdeed someone else is blamed for, they're tasked by the Bubblegum Princes with arresting their own scapegoat. They reason that the Bubblegum Princess wouldn't willy-nilly hate someone, so the arrestee must be a bad dude and under this logic, Finn agrees to perform. Finn often partakes in sophistry in order to not compromise his hero values. "Think about it," Jake states:</p>
<blockquote>If Bubblegum hates him so much, then he must have done some rotten stuff. I mean, maybe he even threw a bottle and turned someone ugly before.
Finn: Maybe you're right.
Jake: Maybe I am!
Finn: Alright, just this once, we'll be vigilantes!
Jake: Nah, we're more like cops. Crooked cops! [Jake makes a gun with his fingers and pretends to shoot something.]</blockquote>
<p>This exchange is hilarious because Jake is pointing out the intractability of Finn's position: we all compromise ourselves and sometimes you just have to deal with it. His statement is a whole-hearted embrace of ambiguity: there are no general rules for when compromise is acceptable or for what kinds of compromise are more acceptable than others, taken within normal parameters.</p>

<p>That last phrase is key because otherwise the underlying idea will descend into a puddle of useless relativisms and we'll start arguing about whether murder is a justifiable compromise. Instead, it's a more Heideggerian move to say that we humans operate within a world in which meaningful compromise exists and in that world meaning does not shut down, which is the ultimate fear of those who perpetuate whole systems of meaning, such as Catholicism, for example. Thus, the interesting thing is to study when these moves are happening from within a phenomenological framework.</p>

<p>The common theme here is one of encountering reality and instead of trying to shape or mold an environment, to try to understand it and respond, or to examine how response and understanding are even possible. For instance, Finn has a hero code that he strives to live by but often the only way for Finn to escape or survive or vanquish his enemies is by participating in some kind of dualism and coming to some painful realization that somewhat compromises his hero code.</p>

<p>The ultimate source of ambiguity appears to be that humans are not robots and thus unpredictable. Their least robotic feature is their imagination. In an episode in the first season that deals with imagination, Finn and Jake can't go outside to play because there's a knife storm. Finn is skeptical about imagination, telling his buddy that it's way cooler to trade in reality. In other words, imaginations are controlled environments and they present fake dangers that can easily be wrangled out of: imagination, he seems to be saying, is inauthentic.</p>

<p>Finn is ideologically opposed to Jake's forays into imagination, until he realizes that imagination can be dangerous because their furniture starts melting due to the lava floor Jake has imagined. Suddenly, imagination has erupted into reality and given him a real hero's challenge to rise to. Finn, then, has to battle Jake's invisible imaginings in order to 'turn off' Jake's imagination and rescue them from danger, but then by turning off Jake's imagination, it turns out that he's lobotomized his buddy. Jake turns robotic and uninteresting. Ultimately, our hero must imagine his own solution switch to turn Jake's imagination back on.</p>

<p>In this adventure, Finn must deal with inauthenticity and compromise in order to get his friend back, but he also is forced to recognize that much of the fun in the world comes from these loose categories, from play, from the liminal, category-switching, absurdity and surprise. The human imagination is the home of these things and while one might wish that humans were more robotic and predictable, the result of this wish would be stark and ugly. We would suffer a loss of meaning. Thus, the locus of ambiguity, the place where things switch from one thing to another thing is probably the home of meaning, and at its root this sounds like a quantum mechanics way of saying, at the bottom of our somewhat predictable world is a range of unpredictable behavior. The things we care about and invest with meaning are intractably compromised and conflicted and this isn't a side effect, but a thing that makes the fact of their meaning possible.</p>
