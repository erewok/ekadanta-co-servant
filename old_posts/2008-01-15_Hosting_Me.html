The internet hosting company Dreamhost (which hosts this site and many many others) made a catastrophic error sometime after midnight California time, January 15th, and customers are <a href="http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2008/01/15/billing-issues/#comments">furious</a>.

What happened apparently is that Dreamhost charged their customers for billing services <a href="blog.dreamhost.com">as if the date were Dec. 31, 2008</a> and in most cases charged their customers twice. At the moment Dreamhost's services are pretty cheap, at $119/year for their low-cost hosting plan, but multiply this number by a few times for different sites and  then multiple the package by two and some customers report being billed as much as $4000 for their webhosting plans.

One thing illustrated here is the vulnerability of automatic bill-payment services online. All it took for the problem to occur was that someone had to run Dreamhost's billing program with one mistaken number (ahem, an "8" for a "7") and suddenly thousands of people have been overcharged (with those who have opted out of automatic bill-payment breathing an audible sigh of relief, as seen in the comments link posted above).

<!--more-->The thing is that now Dreamhost will have to refund all of these customers, some of whom have additionally been hit with overdraft charges and late fees, and some of whom are even complaining that they won't be able to pay their other bills (a mortgage was mentioned in one instance) on time. In fact, it's hard to see how Dreamhost <em>would not </em>responsible, since it was their error, and their responsibility to manage automatic bill-payment responsibly.  Aside from the millions of dollars they may have to refund and the overdraft fees and other charges they appear to be responsible for on top of this, Dreamhost have squandered a great deal of public trust and so may lose thousands of customers, including many of those who were overwhelmed and confused by the mysterious billing emails they received, which threated to shut down hosting services for the recipients.

Finally, the problem should have been pretty easy to prevent, should anyone have thought to prevent it, by forcing the program to not allow a date for the future (or, at least, so far in the future), but overall, it makes a strong argument against automatic bill-payment services. Why would anyone want to trust some invisible person to manage their bank account for them?
