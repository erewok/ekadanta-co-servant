We were passing the San Diego Zoo one afternoon this week, northbound on Park Boulevard, and as we overtook a bus that had stopped to deposit and load passengers, I got a glimpse of an ad slicked across the side. In the ad there was an image of an athletic fellow drinking from a gallon container of orange juice, and the lettering to his right read, "Recycle! Because plastic is too precious to waste!"

Below that, of course, read "Paid for the Plastics Council," because who else would be so insane as to try to convince an American public that "plastic" and "precious" are two terms that deserve to be associated with each other? Anything that we package every other thing in so that we can throw that packaging away is obviously not widely considered precious. Anything that produces the most toxic chemicals known to exist on the planet is obviously not precious. And if <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/la-na-plastic16apr16,1,1100237.story?track=rss">recent science on plastic</a> is to be believed, this abundant space-age polymer is really just a vile laboratory trick, a molecular magic show meant to mislead us into thinking that we can get away with all kinds of abominable chemical management.

In fact, all the plastic that's ever been manufactured is still with us, most likely floating in the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/la-me-ocean2aug02,0,5274274,full.story">pacific ocean</a>.
