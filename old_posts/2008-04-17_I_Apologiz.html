In the mail just now arrived the strangest political mailer I've ever received. It was sent to me by the good people over at John Hartley for City Council and a banner across the top reads "I apologize!" Hartley moves on to explain to his confused potential constituents (this one included) what it is he's so sorry about:
<blockquote>It all started because I had to take a leak; and the next time I'm walking door to door and I have to take a leak, I promise not to do it in my truck, but to find a bathroom instead.

I harbor no hard feelings towards the police or the city attorney, who were doing their job, or towards the women who complained, who care about our neighborhoods, or towards the press, who have been working to inform the public.</blockquote>

Geez, John, everyone knows that if you have to whizz, you go into a coffee shop and tell them that you're going to order something as soon as you get out of the bathroom, and then once you're out of the bathroom you just tell them you've changed your mind.

Still, there might be some <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_8957295">other aspects to his arrest</a> that Mr. Hartley isn't telling us about, including the part about "masturbating in the street" (as stated in the Mercury article linked above). It's hard to believe too that sending out a mailer like this will help John win anyone over, especially people like me who'd never heard of him, but who now see him as the guy allegedly urinating in a cup and masturbating on the street.
