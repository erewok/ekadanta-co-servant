I am not sure all of these 90s-band reunions tell me anything about myself, but they might. It's only worth commenting if they talk about the culture and I think they do, but my title is purposely provocative because I think there is an internet attitude that "any information can be had" that is the source of this surge.

Says Malkmus, “A reunion is a communal nostalgic thing and its about the past, it’s about now, but it’s about then and what that was like, and what we’re like today—we’re still standing or whatever, we’re still here together.”

Also, So, any long time fans who were expecting boring esoteric secrets should have no fear. Nastanovich, ever bright and sunny, is excited and slightly apprehensive, as the band will probably be playing to larger audiences than they were ever used to: “Since the band stopped, I think we’re more popular than we were when we actually existed.” The statement raises an interesting philosophical question as to whether a thing needs to exist to be popular.

The second time I saw an Unbroken "reunion" show, it was at the Che Cafe and there were loads of young kids there who could not have been old enough to have seem the first time around (because I was a kid myself and I am not any longer). 

This will be an easy attitude to dismiss. It's reactionary.
